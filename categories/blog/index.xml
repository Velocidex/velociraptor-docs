&lt;p>Like GRR, Velociraptor also maintains a virtual file system view (VFS)
of the client's filesystem. GRR's VFS view is generated by adding a
row for each file into the database. In order to refresh the view of a
certain directory, GRR issues a ListDirectory request and updates the
database by storing each newly discovered file in its own row.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor models the client's VFS as a per-directory VQL query. In
order to refresh the view of a certain directory, a new VQL query is
issued to the client, essentially collecting the glob information for
that directory in a single VQL response table. The VQL result is then
stored in a single database row. Therefore Velociraptor stores a single
row per directory (as compared to GRR's single row per file approach).
This leads to a huge reduction in database rows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tradeoff however, is that the Velociraptor VFS view can only show
the state of the entire directory listing at a single point in time.
GRR's VFS viewer can show old files (which have been removed) mixed in
with current files because it can merge the output of different
ListDirectory operations that occurred in different times. We decided
this feature was not often useful and sometimes actually led to
confusion since files that are removed from a directory are shown
together with files currently present. Velociraptor therefore shows the
VFS directory at the latest timestamp the entire directory was fetched.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="recursive-vfs-refresh">Recursive VFS refresh&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Users who are more familiar with traditional forensic tools (or GUI file
managers like Windows Explorer) usually attempt to browse the client's
VFS view interactively, searching for files and directories relevant to
the case. However, since the VFS view is only a cached database view of
the real client's file system, we need to go to the client to refresh
the cache whenever we try to view a directory in the VFS which had not
yet been fetched from the client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since clients are not always online, some users attempt to just
recursively refresh the entire VFS view (i.e. recursively list all
client directories from the root). This is however, an expensive
operation (This is at least as expensive as running a recursive &amp;quot;find /
-ls&amp;quot; command on the commandline). Due to GRR's extensive data model
and complex multi-round trip flow model, performing a recursive VFS
refresh with GRR is unlikely to work in any reasonable time (typically
the flow will run for a while then hang due to race conditions in the
frontend).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, Velociraptor issues a single VQL request as a
recursive directory glob and stores the entire directory content in a
single VQL response taken at an instance in time. The response is
streamed back to the server. The server simply splits the response table
into directory specific tables, and then stores a single VQL response
table for each directory in the database.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>The VQL glob() plugin is guaranteed to generate results in breadth first
order. This means that it emits information about all files in the same
directory first, before recursing into sub directories. This feature
makes it simple to split the result table into directory specific
sub-tables by simply watching the FullPath column and noting when its
directory changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;h1 id="very-large-vql-queries">Very large VQL queries&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>While we claimed above that Velociraptor simply issues a single VQL
query and stores its result in a single database row, this was an
oversimplification. If the VQL query generates too many rows, the
Velociraptor client splits the response into parts (by default 10000
rows per part). This allows data to be uploaded immediately to the
server and processed while the query is still executing on the client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the VFSListDirectoryflow was issued with a glob of /**10
(i.e. refresh the entire VFS view from the root directory, recursively
into a depth of 10 directories). The VQL query executed was:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT FullPath AS _FullPath,
 Name, Size, Mode,
 timestamp(epoch=Sys.Mtim.Sec) AS mtime,
 timestamp(epoch=Sys.Atim.Sec) AS atime,
 timestamp(epoch=Sys.Ctim.Sec) AS ctime
FROM glob(globs='/**10')
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The query was issued to a Velociraptor client running on a Chromebook.
This particular system has approximately 500k files in its root
filesystem, and so the response consists of 500k rows. However, as the
query executes, the response is split into multiple parts, each being
10k rows, and uploaded (each part is about 3mb in total).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="5fb6b9fb09f1795dc718ea6dcb234c98">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#5fb6b9fb09f1795dc718ea6dcb234c98" class="figure">

 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total execution time for this query is about 4 minutes and consists of
about 50 parts (around 2.5mb each). It is still an expensive query, but
depending on the urgency of the case, it may well be warranted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is very convenient to just take a snapshot of the entire filesystem,
especially when the client is offline. We can issue the flow and then
when the client comes back online we can review all the files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="file-uploads">File uploads&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The VFS view is just a local cache in the data store of what is really
going on the client. While we can see the file in each directory we cant
transfer all the file content. Velociraptor represents downloaded files
differently from just listed files. Files with the floppy disk next to
them represent files that we have a local cache for. We can view the
Hexview or just download them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can always initiate a download of a VFS file by selecting the
Download tab. Unlike GRR, Velociraptor does not keep previous versions
of files - a re-download will overwrite the previous file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Velociraptor's client communications</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/03/velociraptor_s_client_communications/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/03/velociraptor_s_client_communications/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="how-does-the-grr-client-communicate">How does the GRR client communicate?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The GRR client protocol is depicted below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="1c2feb8effbc7c5584f7b8380982192f">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#1c2feb8effbc7c5584f7b8380982192f" class="figure">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="comms1.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to network realities such as NAT, firewalls etc, it is not possible
to directly connect to the client, so GRR relies on the client
connecting to the server in order to communicate with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GRR client makes periodic POST requests to the server to both send
replies and receive new instructions. Since POST requests are very short
lived (most client polls carry no data) the client has to repeat the
polls periodically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two parameters which determine how the GRR client behaves
-poll_max and poll_min. When there is some requests sent to the
client, the client will reduce its poll wait time to poll_min (default
0.2 seconds). When nothing happens, the client will increase its poll
time gradually up to poll_max (default 10 minutes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having long poll times means that any new flows launched on an idle
client must wait for up to 10 minutes before the client polls again in
order to send the new requests to the client. Unfortunately reducing the
poll_max setting actually increases server load, as the server needs to
hit the database more often to serve each poll. This scheme essentially
poses a trade off - for a responsive client, we must have a low
poll_max (i.e. more frequent polls) but this increases the load on the
frontend so it can not be too low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When GRR is normally deployed it produces 2 types of clients on the web
interface: the debug client has max_poll set to 5 seconds making
testing easier because it is more responsive, but the non-debug version
has max_poll set to 10 minutes. For example at Velocidex, one of our
clients had once accidentally deployed the debug version and the server
was slammed with 5 second polls from several thousand clients! This
rendered the server useless, returning HTTP 500 status codes for most
client polls. The only way to recover was to push new config to the
clients and restart their GRR service in order to lower the poll
frequency and recover control over the deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="catastrophic-failure-under-load">Catastrophic failure under load&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The other problem with GRR's client communication protocol is that it
tends to exhibit catastrophic failure under load. When the client makes
a HTTP POST operation, the server goes through the following steps in
order:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Unpack and decrypts any replies the client sends in its POST message&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Queue these replies on a worker queue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read the client's job queue for any outstanding requests to the
client.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pack and encrypt these requests to the client.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write them as the body response of the HTTP POST with hopefully a
200 HTTP status.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In previous posts we have seen that GRR's overuse of queuing leads to
extreme loads on the database, so under load (e.g. when a large hunt is
taking place), the above process may take some time until the server can
obtain a lock on the database row, write and read the messages, and
compose its response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What tends to happen under load, is that the client will time the
request out if the server takes too long, or the server itself may
timeout the request with a HTTP 500 code. The client, thinking it has
not got through will try to POST the same data again (this time it will
wait longer though).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This essentially makes things worse, because the replies are probably
already mostly queued so the next retry will re-queue the same requests
(these will be discarded by the worker anyway but they are still
queued), increasing database pressure and server load. This manifests in
a critical meltdown of the frontends who pretty soon serve mostly 500
errors (making things worse again).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the reason why resource provision is so important with GRR, if
the frontends are just too slow to be able to keep up, the connections
will start to timeout, and load increases (rather than decreases)
causing a catastrophic failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-can-we-fix-this">How can we fix this?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The main problem with a polling scheme is that the user experience is
terrible - even if we reduce the poll wait times to few seconds, users
will have to wait to view the results of their actions - leading to an
overall experience of a slow and sluggish system. For a responsive user
interface we need to have client round trips of a second or less and
having poll_max set this low will just use up too many resources. This
is particularly noticeable in the VFS browser since it takes so long to
navigate to the desired directory and download files interactively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other endpoint monitoring systems use distributed pub/sub systems like
RabbitMQ or Firebase realtime database to inform the clients of new
requests. In those systems, the client makes a TCP connection to an
endpoint and holds the connection open for long periods of time, the
server can then immediately push new requests to the client as soon as
they are published. This seems like the way to go but we did not want to
introduce another dependency on Velociraptor (we really like it being a
self contained - working out of the box binary).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular we also wanted to solve the catastrophic failure we saw
with GRR clients under load (described above). This means that we need
to make sure that the clients are not sending data faster than the
server can process it. We definitely want to avoid the POST timing out
with a 500 error and the client retrying the same POST since this is the
main cause for the catastrophic failures we experienced with GRR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can do this by keeping the client's connection open for as long as
we need, but in order to not time it out, we send the HTTP status code
immediately, then process the POST data, while sending the client
keepalive data periodically using HTTP chunked transfer encoding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To the client, and any proxies in the way, it simply looks like the POST
request was received immediately, and the response body is downloaded
slowly (there is always some pad data flowing so none of the TCP or HTTP
timers are triggered since the connection is always active). This is
illustrated in the diagram below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="1049cb81ad68eeee5c83b830bd634dc0">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#1049cb81ad68eeee5c83b830bd634dc0" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="comms2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scheme has the two main advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>By returning a 200 status to the client before we begin processing,
the client knows we received the data. They are then able to
de-queue these messages and will not transmit them again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By keeping the client connected while the server is processing the
request we avoid any additional data from being sent to the server
while it is busy. The client will be blocked on the HTTP connection
and will actually pause its running VQL query while the server is
processing the current responses. This mechanism actually throttles
the clients to allow the server to keep up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="making-the-client-more-responsive">Making the client more responsive&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We really wanted to make clients more responsive. We were frankly sick
of having to wait up to 10 minutes to access a client that we knew was
online in our IR work. To make the client more responsive we wanted to
use the same technique to keep the client connection open for long
periods of time, and then send instructions to the client as soon as the
user issues a new flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the GRR scheme new requests are sent on the same connections as
client replies are received. This won't work if the client connection
is held open for long periods of time because while the client is
blocked reading new responses from the server, it can not send any
replies (the POST header was already sent).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fix this we switched to two separate POST connections on two server
handlers, a reader handler and a writer handler. The writer handler only
receives messages from the client to the server (i.e. replies to client
requests), while the reader handler blocks the client for prolonged time
and sends client requests as soon as new flows are launched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scheme allows a full duplex, responsive communication protocol,
with no polling overheads. This can be seen in the diagram below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="fbd22245e4ecd85fe78b30f41b9585c9">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#fbd22245e4ecd85fe78b30f41b9585c9" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="comms3.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The client establishes the reader channel by sending a HTTP POST request
to the reader handler. The server checks for any messages for the
client, and sees that there are none pending. It will then keep the
client's connection open as before, trickle sending pad data (using
HTTP chunked transfer encoding) to keep the connection open for as long
as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the user launches a new flow, the server can immediately forward
the client's requests on the open channel, completing the POST
operation. The client will then process the requests and send the
responses with a separate HTTP POST to the writer channel. In the
meantime the reader channel will re-POST to the reader handler and
become blocked and ready for the next request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scheme has the following advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The user's flow is executed instantly by the client. This makes for
example, the VFS browser instant - as soon as the user clicks the
&amp;quot;refresh directory listing&amp;quot; button, the directory is refreshed. As
soon as the user wants to view a file, the file is downloaded etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is hardly any polling activity. The clients open a reader
connection once and hold it for many minutes. The server need only
check the queue at the beginning of the connection and then only if
it knows there is a new flow launched for this client. This means
server load is really low.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>However, the scheme also has some disadvantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>TCP connections are held for long periods of time tying up server
resources. In particular the open sockets count towards the
process's open file descriptor limit. It is typically necessary to
increase this limit (by default it is 1024 which is very low).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploying over multiple servers is a bit more complex because a
client may be blocked on one server and the flow is launched on
another server. Velociraptor now has a notification API to allow
inter server RPCs to propagate notifications between servers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We believe that these limitations can be easily managed. They are no
different from typical limitations of large scale pub/sub systems (they
too need to hold many TCP connections open). In our testing we have not
seen a problem scaling to many thousands of connected clients with very
low resource use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor now also has a pool client that allows spinning up several
thousand clients at the same time. This helps with testing a deployment
to make sure it can handle the increased open file limit and test how
large scale hunts can be handled.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The new responsive client communications protocol allows for near
instantaneous access to clients. This actually reduces the overall load
on the system because we do not need to perform frequent client polls
just to check if a new flow is launched. User experience is much better
as users can interact with clients immediately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Velociraptor API and FUSE</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/08/28/the_velociraptor_api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/08/28/the_velociraptor_api/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="mynotices warning">
 &lt;div heading="warning">&lt;p>This page is written about a very old version of Velociraptor and is
retained for historical purposes. Currently the fuse feature was removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>The Velociraptor GUI is very useful, but for the power user, the
Velociraptor API provides a powerful mechanism to integrate and
automate. We previously discussed how the Velociraptor API can be used
by external programs. This post explore a sample program that uses the
API and presents a client&amp;rsquo;s VFS as a FUSE directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allows us to navigate the remote end point&amp;rsquo;s file system as if it
was mounted locally - we can list directories or fetch files, or even
open remote files using third party programs. All the while, these
actions are fully audited on the server and the collected files are
stored in Velociraptor&amp;rsquo;s file store for archiving and evidence
preservation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider an analyst investigating an end point. The analyst has some
third party tools on their workstation which they would like to use on
files obtained from the end point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a way of creating the illusion of a
real filesystem using software. When various programs on the computer
requests filesystem operations, such as listing files in a directory
or reading a file, Velociraptor takes over and emulates these
requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor&amp;rsquo;s built in FUSE program emulates a filesystem by
exporting a client&amp;rsquo;s cached VFS on the server to the FUSE layer. If
the analyst attempts to list a directory that the server has no cache
of - the server will issue a new directory listing request from the
endpoint. If the endpoint is currently online, the updated directory
listing will be returned to the server, and in turn relayed to the
analyst&amp;rsquo;s workstation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The overall effect is that as the analyst navigates around the FUSE
filesystem on their workstation, they are issuing collection requests
from the endpoint, and reading their responses in such as way that it
appears the endpoint is really mounted on the FUSE filesystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>![Image](../Fuse overview.png)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above figure shows all the components and how they are
related. Assume the FUSE filesystem is mounted on drive &lt;code>Q:&lt;/code> in the
analyst&amp;rsquo;s workstation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Suppose the analyst is navigating the file &lt;code>Q:\file\&lt;/code> using Windows
Explorer.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Velociraptor&amp;rsquo;s FUSE program running on the analyst workstation will
issue an API request to list the &lt;code>file&lt;/code> directory within the
client&amp;rsquo;s VFS on the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If the server has a locally cached version of this VFS directory in
its data store it will return it immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>However, if no server side cache exists, the FUSE program will
issue a directory listing request to the endpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The endpoint will respond to this and return the directory listing
(if it is currently online).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now the server will contain a cached copy of the VFS directory and
can return it (just as in step 3 above).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Velociraptor FUSE program on the workstation can return the
directory listing to the Windows kernel and this will be fed back
into the Windows Explorer. The end result is that Windows Explorer
appears to be navigating the endpoint&amp;rsquo;s filesystem directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You can see this process in the screenshot below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>For example if you are logged in as user &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo;, then any FUSE drives

&lt;p>Simply press Ctrl-C to stop the FUSE program as any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The FUSE feature is a perfect example of a useful API program. The
program fully automates the Velociraptor server - it received cached
information about the client&amp;rsquo;s VFS status, and then automatically
issues new collection requests as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This kind of automated control of the Velociraptor server opens the
door to many such applications. From automated response to
remediation and automated evidence collection.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>Some users has asked us what the difference between the FUSE program
and other tools, e.g. F-Response which also create the illusion that
the remote system is mounted on the analyst&amp;rsquo;s workstation. The main
difference is that Velociraptor does not export the &lt;em>raw block device&lt;/em>
from the endpoint - it simply exports the files and directories we
collected already. So for example, it is not possible to run a low
level disk analysis system (such as X-Ways) on the mounted FUSE
drive. However you can still run specialized file parsers (such as
Kape or log2timeline) as long as they do not require access to the raw
devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>

using PowerShell. There are many reasons why Agentless hunting is
appealing - there are already a ton of endpoint agents and yet another
one may not be welcome. Sometimes we need to deploy endpoint agents as
part of a DFIR engagement and we may not want to permanently install yet
another agent on end points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post explores an agentless deployment scenario, where we do
not want to install Velociraptor permanently on the end point, but
rather push it to end points temporarily to collect specific artifacts.
The advantage of this method is that there are no permanent changes to
the end point, as nothing is actually installed. However, we do get the
full power of Velociraptor to collect artifacts, hunt for evil and
more...&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="agentless-velociraptor">Agentless Velociraptor&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Normally when deploying Velociraptor as a service, the binary is copied
to the system and a service is installed. The service ensures that the
binary is restarted when the system reboots, and so Velociraptor is
installed on a permanent basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in the agentless deployment scenario we simply run the binary
from a network share using group policy settings. The downside to this
approach is that the endpoint needs to be on the domain network to
receive the group policy update (and have the network share accessible)
before it can run Velociraptor. When we run in Agentless mode we are
really after collecting a bunch of artifacts via hunts and then exiting&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the agent will not restart after a reboot. So this method is suitable
for quick hunts on corporate (non roaming) assets.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In this post I will use Windows 2019 Server but this should also work on
any older version.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-a-network-share">Creating a network share&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first step is to create a network share with the Velociraptor binary
and its configuration file. We will run the binary from the share in
this example, but for more reliability you may want to copy the binary
into e.g. a temp folder on the end point in case the system becomes
disconnected from the domain. For quick hunts though it should be fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We create a directory on the server (I will create it on the domain
controller but you should probably not do that - find another machine to
host the share).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a directory C:\\Users\\Deployment and ensured that it is
read only. I have shared the directory as the name Deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I now place the Velociraptor executable and client config file in that
directory and verify that I can run the binary from the network share.
The binary should be accessible via
`\\\\DC\Deployment\velociraptor.exe`:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-the-group-policy-object">Creating the group policy object.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Next we create the group policy object which forces all domain connected
machines to run the Velociraptor client. We use the Group Policy
Management Console:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="10fb15c77258a991b0028080a64fb42d">

 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select the OU or the entire domain and click &amp;quot;Create New GPO&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="09dd8c2662b96ce14928333f055c5580">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#09dd8c2662b96ce14928333f055c5580" class="figure">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="4.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now right click the GPO object and select &amp;quot;Edit&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="8266e4bfeda1bd42d8f9794eb4ea0a13">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="5.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will create a new scheduled task. Rather than schedule it at a
particular time, we will select to run it immediately. This will force
the command to run as soon as the endpoint updates its group policy
settings (i.e. we do not want to wait for the next reboot of the
endpoint).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="f19c9085129709ee14d013be869df69b">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="6.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next we give the task a name and a description. In order to allow
Velociraptor to access raw devices (e.g. to collect memory or NTFS
artifacts) we can specify that the client will run at
NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges, and run without any user being
logged on. It is also worth ticking the &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; checkbox here to
prevent a console box from appearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="9eb9cd58b9ea5e04c890326b5c1f471f">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="7.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next click the Actions tab and add a new action. This is where we launch
the Velociraptor client. The program will simply be launched from the
share (i.e. \\\\\\\\DC\\Deployment\\velociraptor.exe) and we
give it the arguments allowing it to read the provided configuration
file (i.e.
--config \\\\\\\\DC\\Deployment\\client.config.yaml client -v).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="602e8f042f463dc47ebfdf6a94ed5a6d">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="8.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the setting tab we can control how long we want the client to run.
For a quick hunt this may be an hour or two but maybe for a DFIR
engagement it might be a few days. The GPO will ensure the client is
killed after the allotted time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="7afbb1602613ec52b265d7a54ad27330">

 &lt;a class="image-link" href="9.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the GPO is installed it becomes active for all domain machines. You
can now schedule any hunts you wish using the Velociraptor GUI. When a
domain machine refreshes its group policy it will run the client, which
will enroll and immediately participate in any outstanding hunts - thus
collecting and delivering its artifacts to the server. After the
allotted time has passed, the client will shut down without having
installed anything on the endpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can force a group policy update by running the gpupdate program. Now
you can verify that Velociraptor is running:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="persistence">Persistence&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Note that when running Velociraptor in agent less mode you probably want
to configure it so that the writeback file is written to the temp
directory. The writeback file is how the client keeps track of its key
material (and identity). The default is to store it in the client's
installation folder, but you should probably change it in the client's
config file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Client:
 writeback_windows: $TEMP\\velociraptor.writeback.yaml
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The file will remain in the client's temp directory so if you ever
decide to run the agentless client again (by pushing another group
policy) the client id remains the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Agentless hunting with Velociraptor</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/03/02/agentless_hunting_with_velociraptor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/03/02/agentless_hunting_with_velociraptor/</guid><description>&lt;p>There has been a lot of interest lately in Agentless hunting especially

queries that can detect specific conditions. These conditions can be
used to create alerts and escalation actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most useful types of alerts is detecting a pattern of
activity. For example we can detect failed and successful login attempts
separately, but it is the specific pattern of events (say 5 failed login
attempts followed by a successful one) that is interesting from a
detection point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post illustrates how this kind of temporal correlation can be
expressed in a VQL query. We then use it to create alerts for attack
patterns commonly seen by intrusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="event-queries">Event Queries&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Velociraptor executes queries written in the Velociraptor Query Language
(VQL). The queries can be executed on the client, and their results
streamed to the server. Alternatively the queries may be executed on the
server and process the result of other queries which collected
information from the client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A VQL query does not have to terminate at all. VQL queries draw their
data from a VQL plugin which may simply return data rows at different
times. For example, consider the following query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT EventData as FailedEventData,
 System as FailedSystem
FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
WHERE System.EventID = 4625
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This query sets up a watcher on a windows event log file. As new events
are written to the log file, the query will produce those events as new
rows. The rows will then be filtered so we only see event id 4625
(Failed logon event).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor can implement event queries on the client or on the server.
For example, say we wanted to collect all failed event logs with the
query above. We would write an artifact that encapsulates this query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Windows.System.FailedLoginAttempts
parameters:
 - name: securityLogFile
 default: C:/Windows/System32/Winevt/Logs/Security.evtx
sources:
 - queries:
 - SELECT EventData as FailedEventData,
 System as FailedSystem
 FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
 WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4625
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then we simply add that artifact to the monitored artifact list in the
config file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Events:
 artifacts:
 - Generic.Client.Stats
 - Windows.System.FailedLoginAttempts
 version: 2
 ops_per_second: 10
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The monitored artifacts are run on all clients connected to the server.
The output from these queries is streamed to the server and stored in
the client's monitoring VFS directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets test this artifact by trying to run a command using the runas
windows command. We will be prompted for a password but failing to give
the correct password will result in a login failure event:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;img class="inline" src="1.png" />




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few seconds the event will be written to the windows event log
and the watch_evtx() VQL plugin will emit the row - which will be
streamed to the VFS monitoring directory on the server, where it can be
viewed in the GUI:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above screenshot shows that the monitoring directory now contains a
subdirectory named after the artifact we created. Inside this directory
are CSV files for each day and every failed logon attempt is detailed
there.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="time-correlation">Time correlation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>While it is interesting to see all failed logon attempts in many cases
these events are just noise. If you put any server on the internet (e.g.
an RDP or SSH server) you will experience thousands of brute force
attempts to break in. This is just the nature of the internet. If your
password policy is strong enough it should not be a big problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, what if someone guesses the password for one of your accounts?
Then the activity pattern is more like a bunch of failed logons followed
by a successful logon for the same account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pattern is way more interesting than just watching for a series of
failed logons (although that is also good to know).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how do we write a query to detect this? Essentially the query needs
to look back in time to see how many failed logon attempts preceded
each successful logon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a typical problem which may be generalized as followed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>::: {.admonition}
Goal&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We want to detect an event A proceeded by a specified number of events B
within a defined time window.
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This problem may be generalized for example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Detect a user account created and deleted within a short time
window.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A beacon to a specific DNS followed by at least 5 beacons within the
last 5 hours to same DNS (Event A and B are the same).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="the-fifo-plugin">The fifo() plugin&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>How shall we write the VQL query to achieve this? This is made possible
by use of the fifo() plugin. As its name suggests, the FIFO plugin acts
as a First In First Out cache for event queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plugin is given a subquery which is also a VQL query generating its
own events. As the subquery generates events, each event is kept in the
fifo plugin's cache in a first in first out manner. Events are also
expired if they are too old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We typically store the query in a variable. Each time the variable is
queried the cache is returned at once. To illustrate how this works
consider the following query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">LET fifo_events = SELECT * FROM fifo(
 max_rows=5,
 query={
 SELECT * from watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
 WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4625
 })

SELECT * FROM foreach(
 row={
 SELECT * FROM clock(period=60)
 },
 query={
 SELECT * from fifo_events
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The first query is stored into the fifo_events variable. When it is
first defined, the fifo() VQL plugin launches its subquery and simply
collects its output into its local cache in a fifo manner. This will
essentially keep the last 5 rows in its cache.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second query runs the clock() plugin to receive a clock event every
60 seconds. For each of these events, we select from the fifo_events
variable - that is we select the last 5 failed events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see that this allows us to query the last 5 events in the fifo
cache for every clock event. If we now replace the clock event with a
successful logon event this query will do exactly what we want:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode"># This query will generate failed logon events - one per row, as
# they occur.
- LET failed_logon = SELECT EventData as FailedEventData,
 System as FailedSystem
 FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
 WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4625

# This query will create a fifo() to contain the last 5 failed
# logon events.
- LET last_5_events = SELECT FailedEventData, FailedSystem
 FROM fifo(query=failed_logon,
 max_rows=5,
 max_age=atoi(string=failedLogonTimeWindow))

# This query simply generates successful logon events.
- LET success_logon = SELECT EventData as SuccessEventData,
 System as SuccessSystem
 FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
 WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4624

# For each successful event, we select the last 5 failed events
# and count them (using the group by). If the count is greater
# than 3 then we emit the row as an event.
- SELECT * FROM foreach(
 row=success_logon,
 query={
 SELECT SuccessSystem.TimeCreated.SystemTime AS LogonTime,
 SuccessSystem, SuccessEventData, FailedEventData,
 FailedSystem, count(items=SuccessSystem) as Count
 FROM last_5_events
 WHERE FailedEventData.SubjectUserName = SuccessEventData.SubjectUserName
 GROUP BY LogonTime
 }) WHERE Count &amp;gt; 3
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The above query simply watches the event log for failed logins and
populates a fifo() with the last 5 failed events. At the same time we
monitor the event log for successful logon events. If we see a
successful event, we go back and check the last 5 failed events and
count them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the failed events are for the same user and there are more than 3
then we report this as an event. We now have a high value event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's see what it looks like when such an event is triggered:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="10fb15c77258a991b0028080a64fb42d">

&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like before, the events are written to a daily CSV log, one event
per CSV row. It is a bit hard to see in the GUI since there is a lot of
data, (We probably need some GUI work to improve this) but there is a
single row emitted for each event, and the FailedEventData column
contains a list of all the failed login attempts stored in the fifo().&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="server-side-queries">Server side queries.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We have seen how the fifo() plugin can be used in the monitoring
artifact itself to have the client detect its own events. However, the
endpoint is usually only able to see its own events in isolation. It
would be nice to be able to detect patterns only evident by seeing
concerted behaviour from multiple endpoints at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, consider the pattern of an attacker who compromised domain
credentials running multiple PowerShell Remoting commands across the
entire domain. A command like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&amp;gt; Invoke-Command –ComputerName testcomputer -ScriptBlock {Hostname}
TestComputer
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This command will generate multiple event log entries, including event
4624 (logon) on each host. While in isolation, on each individual
endpoint this event is not suspicious, we might consider seeing this
event repeated within a short time across the domain suspicious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To set that up we would run the following artifact as a monitoring
artifact on all endpoints:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Windows.Event.SuccessfulLogon
sources:
 - queries:
 - SELECT EventData as SuccessEventData,
 System as SuccessSystem
 FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
 WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4624
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>On the server we simple install a watcher on all monitoring events from
this artifact and feed the result to the fifo(). This fills the fifo()
with the last 500 successful logon events from all clients within the
last 60 seconds:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">LET last_successful_logons = SELECT * FROM fifo(
 max_rows=500,
 max_time=60,
 query={
 SELECT * FROM watch_monitoring(
 artifact=&amp;quot;Windows.Event.SuccessfulLogon&amp;quot;)
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>By counting the number of such unique events we can determine if there
were too many successful logon events from different hosts within the
last minute. This might indicate a scripted use of powershell remoting
across the domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In this post we have seen how to write artifacts which capture a time
ordered pattern of behavior. This technique is useful to codify common
attack techniques. The technique is general and we can use the same idea
on server side queries to correlate events from many hosts at the same
time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Velociraptor Performance</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/02/10/velociraptor_performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2019 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/02/10/velociraptor_performance/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are often asked how many resources does a Velociraptor deployment
use? How should one spec a machine for a Velociraptor deployment?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have previously said that one of the reasons we developed
Velociraptor was to improve on the performance of GRR which was not
scalable for our use case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have been working with the team at Klein &amp;amp; Co. on several
intrusions over the past several months, which are providing valuable
opportunities to deploy and test Velociraptor in a range of real world
investigation scenarios. Through this process, we have been able to
extend Velociraptor&amp;rsquo;s functionality and prove its performance on real
client networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I would write a short blog post to show how Velociraptor
performed on such a recent engagement. In this engagement we deployed
Velociraptor on AWS and selectively pushed the client to around 600
machines running a mix of MacOS and Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post will hopefully give readers some idea of how scalable the tool
is and the typical workloads we run with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-server">The Server&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Since this is a smallish deployment we used a single VM with 32Gb of RAM
and 8 cores. This was definitely over speced for this job as most of the
time the server consumed less than 10% of one core:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">top - 06:26:13 up 29 days, 2:31, 5 users, load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
Tasks: 214 total, 1 running, 213 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie

KiB Mem: 32948060 total, 14877988 used, 18070072 free, 411192 buffers

 8 root 20 0 0 0 0 S 0.3 0.0 7:16.30 [rcuos/0]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can see that the server consumed about 95mb when operating normally
and CPU usage was around 3% of one core.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this engagement we knew that we would be collecting a lot of data
and so we specified a large 500gb volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="hunt-performance">Hunt performance&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Velociraptor works by collecting &amp;quot;Artifacts&amp;quot; from clients. Artifacts
are simply encapsulated VQL queries which specify something to search
for on the endpoint. Without going into the details of this engagement,
we can say that we collected typical artifacts for a DFIR/Forensic
investigation engagement. In the following I want to explore how well
hunts performed for the following typical artifacts in order of
complexity:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Search the filesystem for a file glob.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download the $MFT from the root filesystem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run a Yara scan over every file on all mounted filesystems.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We ran these artifact collections over a large number of hosts (between
400-500) that fell within the scope of our engagement. Although the
number of hosts is not huge, we hope to demonstrate Velociraptor's
scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="searching-for-a-file-glob">Searching for a file glob&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the simplest and most common tasks in DFIR is to search the
filesystem for a glob based on filename. This requires traversing
directories and matching the filename based on the user specified
expression - for example, find all files with the extension *.exe
within the C:\\Users directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor can glob over the entire filesystem or over a limited set
of files. Typically a full filesystem glob can take some minutes on the
endpoint (it is equivalent to running the find unix command) and touches
every file. We typically try to limit the scope of the glob as much as
possible (e.g. only search system directories) but sometimes it is nice
to run a glob over all mounted filesystems to make sure we don't miss
anything. In this case we opted for a full filesystem scan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We searched the entire deployment using a hunt (The hunt is constructed
using the File Finder flow in the GUI) which just launches the artifact
collection. Therefore the horizontal distance between the red and blue
dot, in the graph below, represents the total time taken by the host to
collect the artifact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The graph shows how many hosts were recruited into this hunt on the Y
axis. The X axis show the number of seconds since the hunt launch. The
red points indicate the time when clients started their collection,
while the blue dots indicate the time when the client completed the
artifact collection and the server saved its results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inset shows the same data but zoomed into the time origin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor improves and builds on the initial ideas implemented within
the GRR DFIR tool, and so it is interesting to compare this graph to a
typical graph produced by GRR's hunt (reproduced from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287613000285" target="_blank" >this
paper&lt;/a>
).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="2f03cb52684585972bce4635a9bed3e2">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#2f03cb52684585972bce4635a9bed3e2" class="figure">

 &lt;a class="image-link" href="grr_hunt.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first noticeable difference is that Velociraptor clients complete
their collection much faster than GRR's (the horizontal distance
between the red and blue dots represents the time between when the
collection is issued and the time it completes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason for this is that GRR's communication protocol relies on
polling (by default every 10 minutes). Also, since hunting is so
resource intensive in GRR, the clients actually poll the hunt foreman
task every 30 minutes by default. This means that GRR clients typically
have to wait up to 30 minutes to run a hunt!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second difference is the slope of the line around the start of the
hunt. GRR implements a hunt client rate - clients are recruited into the
hunt slowly (by default 20 per minute) in order to limit the load on the
frontends. Unlike GRR, Velociraptor does not implement a hunt rate since
the Velociraptor frontend load is controlled by limiting concurrency
instead (more on this below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that Velociraptor can deliver useful results within seconds
of the hunt starting. We see that this particular filename search
typically takes 25-30 seconds and we see about 200 clients completing
the hunt within this time consistently. The remaining clients are
probably not online and they receive the hunt as they join the network.
This makes Velociraptor hunts far more responsive and useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might also notice a few outliers which spend a long time collecting
this artifact - these machines have probably been shutdown or suspended
while collecting this artifact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="mft-download">MFT Download&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A common technique is to examine the Master File Table (MFT) of an NTFS
volume. By forensically analyzing the MFT it is possible to detect
deleted files, time stomping and build a timeline of the system using
tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/dkovar/analyzeMFT" target="_blank" >&lt;code>analyseMFT.py&lt;/code>&lt;/a>
 or
&lt;a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/ntfswalker" target="_blank" >ntfswalker&lt;/a>
 .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case we decided to collect the $MFT from all the Windows hosts
and post-process them offline. Typically the MFT is around 300-400mb and
could be larger. Therefore this artifact collection is about performance
downloading large quantities of data from multiple hosts quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor can read the raw NTFS partition and therefore read the
$MFT file. We wrote the following artifact to just fetch the $MFT
file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Artifact.NTFS.MFT_puller
description: |
 Uses an NTFS accessor to pull the $MFT

parameters:
- name: path
 default: \\.\C:\$MFT

sources:
- precondition:
 SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'
 queries:
 - SELECT upload(file=path, accessor=&amp;quot;ntfs&amp;quot;) as Upload from scope()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Here is the timing graph for this artifact collection:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This collection takes a lot longer on each host as clients are uploading
around 400mb each to the server, but our server was in the cloud so it
had fast bandwidth. Again we see the hosts that are currently up being
tasked within seconds, while as hosts come online gradually we see them
receiving the hunt and a few minutes later uploading their $MFT file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Was the frontend loaded at the time? I took a screenshot of top on the
server seconds after launching the hunt:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;img class="inline" src="UploadingMFT.png" />




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can see that the CPU load is trivial (4.7%) but the major impact of a
heavy upload collection is the memory used (about 4.7gb - up from about
100mb). The reason is that each client is posting a large buffer of data
(several mb) simultaneously. The server needs to buffer the data before
it can decrypt and process it which takes memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to limit the amount of memory used, Velociraptor limits the
total number of connections it is actively processing to 8-10 concurrent
connections. By carefully managing concurrency we are able to keep a
limit on server memory use. We may lower the total memory use by
reducing the concurrency (and therefore maybe fit into a smaller VM).
Clients simply wait until the server is able to process their uploaded
buffers. If the server takes too long, the clients automatically back
off and retry to send the same buffer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="yara-scan-over-the-entire-filesystem">Yara scan over the entire filesystem&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The final example of a very intense artifact is to scan the entire
filesystem with a YARA rule. This not only requires traversing the
entire filesystem, but also opening each file and searching it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the dangers with such a scan is that users will be negatively
impacted as their workstations start to read every file on disk! The
main resources a YARA scan consumes is disk IO and CPU load. Users might
complain and blame Velociraptor for their machine being slow (disk IO
may negatively affect performance much more than CPU load!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in this case, we don't care how long we take to scan the
user's system, as long as every file was scanned, and as long as the
endpoint is not overloaded and the user's work is not affected. Luckily
Velociraptor allows us to specify the trade-off between collection time
and collection intensity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="velociraptor-rate-limiting">Velociraptor rate limiting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Velociraptor controls client side load by rate limiting the client's
VQL query. Each VQL plugin consumes an &amp;quot;operation&amp;quot; from the throttler.
We define an &amp;quot;operation&amp;quot; as a notional unit of work - the heavier the
VQL plugin's work, the more operations are consumed. For example for
yara scanning, an operation is defined as 1mb of scanned data, or a
single file if the file is smaller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a user issues an artifact collection task, they may limit the rate
at which operations are performed by the client. The Velociraptor agent
then limits the operations to the specified rate. For example, if the
rate is 20 ops/sec then the client will scan less than 20mb per seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other collections may run concurrently at different rates, though; The
client is not blocked while performing a single artifact collection.
This makes sense since we often need to collect a low priority artifact
slowly, but we do not want this to compromise rapid response to that
host.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, one of our targets was a server with large attached
storage. We ran the Yara scan over this system, scanning the first 100Mb
of each file, at a rate of 50 ops/sec. In total we scanned 1.5Tb of
files and the scan took 14 hours (for a total scan rate of 30Mb/sec).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor by default collects the Generic.Client.Stats artifact,
which samples the client's CPU utilization and memory usage every 10
seconds. These samples are streamed to the server and form a record of
the client's footprint on the endpoint. We can use this data to
visualize the effects of performing the yara scan on this host:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Above is the CPU usage on that particular server over the course of a
full day (24 hours). The 14 hour yara scan is clearly visible but at no
time is CPU utilization exceeding 30% of one core. With endpoint disk IO
limited to about 30mb/sec we have achieved a balance between performance
and endpoint load we are happy with.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices warning">
 &lt;div heading="warning">&lt;p>The Python bindings described in this page have now moved to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Velocidex/pyvelociraptor/" target="_blank" >https://github.com/Velocidex/pyvelociraptor/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>Velociraptor is very good at collecting artifacts from endpoints.
However, in modern DFIR work, the actual collection is only the first
step of a much more involved process. Typically we want to post process
data using more advanced data mining tools (such as data stacking).
Velociraptor usually is only a part of a wider solution which might
include a SIEM and SOC integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to facilitate interoperability with other tools, Velociraptor
now offers an external API. The API is offered via gRPC so it can be
used in any language which gRPC supports (e.g. Java, C++, Python etc).
In this blog post we illustrate the Python API but any language should
work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-velociraptor-api-server">The Velociraptor API Server&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The API server exposes an endpoint ready to accept gRPC connections. By
default the API server listen only on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1)
but it is easy to change to be externally accessible if you need by
changing the server.config.yaml file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">API:
 bind_address: 127.0.0.1
 bind_port: 8001
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Client programs simply connect directly to this API and call gRPC
methods on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="ec4cd189b084eac49b5248fb66e6c04a">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#ec4cd189b084eac49b5248fb66e6c04a" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2019/02/09/velociraptor_python_api/api_diagram.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="api_diagram.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The connection is encrypted using TLS and authenticated using mutual
certificates. When we initially created the Velociraptor configuration
file, we created a CA certificate and embedded it in the
server.config.yaml file. It is this CA certificate which is used to
verify that the certificate each end presents was issued by the
Velociraptor CA.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>If you need to have extra security in your environment you should keep
the original server.config.yaml file generated in an offline location,
then deploy a redacted file (without the CA.private_key value) on the
server. This way api client certificates can only be issued offline.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>Before the client may connect to the API server they must have a
certificate issued by the Velociraptor CA. This is easy to generate:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --config server.config.yaml \
 config api_client --name Fred &amp;gt; api_client.yaml
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Will generate something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">ca_certificate: |
 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 MIIDITCCAgmgAwIBAgIRAI1oswXLBFqWVSYZx1VibMkwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQAw
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----
client_cert: |
 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 2e1ftQuzHGD2XPquqfuVzL1rtEIA1tiC82L6smYbeOe0p4pqpsHN1sEDkdfhBA==
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----
client_private_key: |
 -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
 sVr9HvR2kBzM/3yVwvb752h0qDOYDfzLRENjA7dySeOgLtBSvd2gRg==
 -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
api_connection_string: 127.0.0.1:8001
name: Fred
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The certificate generated has a common name as specified by the --name
flag. This name will be logged in the server's audit logs so you can
use this to keep track of which programs have access. This file keeps
both private key and certificate as well as the CA certificate which
must be used to authenticate the server in a single file for
convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="using-the-api-from-python">Using the API from Python&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Although the API exposes a bunch of functions used by the GUI, the main
function (which is not exposed through the GUI) is the Query() method.
This function simply executes one or more VQL queries, and streams their
results back to the caller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The function requires an argument which is a protobuf of type
VQLCollectorArgs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">VQLCollectorArgs:
 env: list of VQLEnv(string key, string value)
 Query: list of VQLRequest(string Name, string VQL)
 max_row: int
 max_wait: int
 ops_per_second: float
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This very simple structure allows the caller to specify one or more VQL
queries to run. The call can set up environment variables prior to the
query execution. The max_row and max_wait parameters indicate how many
rows to return in a single result set and how long to wait for
additional rows before returning a result set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The call simply executes the VQL queries and returns result sets as
VQLResponse protobufs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">VQLResponse:
 Response: json encoded string
 Columns: list of string
 total_rows: total number of rows in this packet
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The VQL query may return many responses - each represents a set of rows.
These responses may be returned over a long time, the API call will
simply wait until new responses are available. For example, the VQL may
represent an event query - i.e. watch for the occurrence of some event
in the system - in this case it will never actually terminate, but keep
streaming response packets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-does-this-look-like-in-code">How does this look like in code?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The following will cover an example implementation in python. The first
step is to prepare credentials for making the gRPC call. We parse the
api_config yaml file and prepare a credential object:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">config = yaml.load(open(&amp;quot;api_client.yaml&amp;quot;).read())
creds = grpc.ssl_channel_credentials(
 root_certificates=config[&amp;quot;ca_certificate&amp;quot;].encode(&amp;quot;utf8&amp;quot;),
 private_key=config[&amp;quot;client_private_key&amp;quot;].encode(&amp;quot;utf8&amp;quot;),
 certificate_chain=config[&amp;quot;client_cert&amp;quot;].encode(&amp;quot;utf8&amp;quot;))

options = (('grpc.ssl_target_name_override', &amp;quot;VelociraptorServer&amp;quot;,),)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next we connect the channel to the API server:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">with grpc.secure_channel(config[&amp;quot;api_connection_string&amp;quot;],
 creds, options) as channel:
 stub = api_pb2_grpc.APIStub(channel)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The stub is the object we use to make calls with. We can then issue our
call:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">request = api_pb2.VQLCollectorArgs(
 Query=[api_pb2.VQLRequest(
 VQL=query,
 )])

for response in stub.Query(request):
 rows = json.loads(response.Response)
 for row in rows:
 print(row)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We issue the query and then just wait for the call to generate response
packets. Each packet may contain several rows which will all be encoded
as JSON in the Response field. Each row is simply a dict with keys being
the column names, and the values being possibly nested dicts or simple
data depending on the query.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-can-we-do-with-this">What can we do with this?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Velociraptor API is deliberately open ended - meaning we do not pose
any limitations on what can be done with it. It is conceptually a very
simple API - just issue the query and look at the results, however this
makes it extremely powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already have a number of very useful server side VQL plugins you can
use. We also plan to add a number of other plugins in future -this means
that the Velociraptor API can easily be extended in a backwards
compatible way by simply adding new VQL plugins. New queries can do
more, without breaking existing queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="post-process-artifacts">Post process artifacts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is the most common use case for the API. Velociraptor deliberately
does not do any post processing on the server - we don't want to slow
the server down by making it do more work than necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But sometimes users need to do some more with the results - for example
upload to an external system, check hashes against Virus Total, and even
initiate an active response like escalation or disruption when something
is detected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a recent engagement we needed to collect a large number of $MFT
files from many endpoints. We wanted to analyze these using external
tools like &lt;code>analyseMFT.py&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wrote a simple artifact to collect the MFT:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Windows.Upload.MFT
description: |
 Uses an NTFS accessor to pull the $MFT

parameters:
 - name: path
 default: \\.\C:\$MFT

sources:
 - precondition:
 SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'

 queries:
 - select upload(file=path, accessor=&amp;quot;ntfs&amp;quot;) as Upload from scope()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We then created a hunt to collect this artifact from the machines of
interest. Once each $MFT file is uploaded we need to run &lt;code>analyseMFT.py&lt;/code>
to parse it:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">QUERY=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
 SELECT Flow,
 file_store(path=Flow.FlowContext.uploaded_files) as Files
 FROM watch_monitoring(artifact='System.Flow.Completion')
 WHERE 'Windows.Upload.MFT' in Flow.FlowContext.artifacts
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

with grpc.secure_channel(config[&amp;quot;api_connection_string&amp;quot;],
 creds, options) as channel:
 stub = api_pb2_grpc.APIStub(channel)
 request = api_pb2.VQLCollectorArgs(
 Query=[api_pb2.VQLRequest(
 VQL=QUERY,
 )])

 for response in stub.Query(request):
 rows = json.loads(response.Response)
 for row in rows:
 for file_name in row[&amp;quot;Files&amp;quot;]:
 subprocess.check_call(
 [&amp;quot;analyseMFT.py&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-f&amp;quot;, file_name,
 &amp;quot;-o&amp;quot;, file_name+&amp;quot;.analyzed&amp;quot;])
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The previous code sets up a watcher query which will receive every
completed flow on the server which collected the artifact
&amp;quot;Windows.Upload.MFT&amp;quot; (i.e. each completed flow will appear as a row to
the query).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can have this program running in the background. We can then launch a
hunt collecting the artifact, and the program will automatically process
all the results from the hunt as soon as they occur. When new machines
are turned on they will receive the hunt, have their $MFT collected and
this program will immediately process that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each flow contains a list of files that were uploaded to it. The
file_store() VQL function reveals the server's filesystem path where
the files actually reside. The server simply stores the uploaded files
on its filesystem since Velociraptor does not use a database (everything
is a file!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The python code then proceeds to launch the &lt;code>analyseMFT.py&lt;/code> script to
parse the $MFT.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>The nice thing with this scheme is that the &lt;code>analyseMFT.py&lt;/code> is running in
its own process and can be managed separately to the main Velociraptor
server (e.g. we can set its execution priority or even run it on a
separate machine). The Velociraptor server does not actually need to
wait for post processing nor will the post processing affect its
performance in any way. If the &lt;code>analyseMFT.py&lt;/code> script takes a long time,
it will just fall behind but it eventually will catch up. In the
meantime, the Velociraptor server will continue receiving the uploads
regardless.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>The above example sets up a watcher query to receive flow results in
real time, but you can also just process the results of a specific hunt
completely using a query like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT Flow, file_store(path=Flow.FlowContext.uploaded_files) as Files
FROM hunt_flows(hunt_id=huntId)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Velociraptor python API opens up enormous possibilities for
automating Velociraptor and interfacing it with other systems. Combining
the power of VQL and the flexibility (and user familiarity) of Python
allows users to build upon Velociraptor in a flexible and creative way.
I am very excited to see what the community will do with this feature -
I can see integration with ELK, BigQuery and other data analytic engines
being a valuable use case.&lt;/p>

This is great, but we still need to create users and assign them
passwords manually. The trouble with user account management is that we
can not enforce 2 factor authentication, or any password policies or any
of the usual enterprise requirements for user account management. It is
also difficult for users to remember yet another password for a separate
system, and so might make the password easily guessable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most enterprise systems require an SSO mechanism to manage user accounts
and passwords. Manual user account management simply does not scale!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post we discuss how to enable Google's SSO authentication for
Velociraptor identity management.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="oauth-identity-management">OAuth Identity management&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Velociraptor can use Google's oauth mechanism to verify a user's
identity. This requires a user to authenticate to Google via their usual
mechanism - if their account requires 2 factor authentication, then
users need to log in this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the user authenticates to Google, they are redirected back into the
Velociraptor application with a token that allows the application to
request information about the user (for example, the username or email
address).&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>OAuth is an authentication protocol. This means Velociraptor can be
pretty confident the user is who they claim they are. This does not
automatically grant them access to the application! A Velociraptor
administrator must still manually grant them access before a user may
log in.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>Before we can use Google for Authentication, we need to register our
Velociraptor deployment as an OAuth App with Google. Unfortunately
Google is not known for having intuitive and easy to follow processes so
actually doing this is complicated and bounces through many seemingly
unrelated Google products and services. This post attempts to document
this process at it exists in this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For our example we assume that our server is located at
&lt;a href="https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com" target="_blank" >https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com&lt;/a>
 as we continue on from our
example in the last post (i.e. it is already configured to use SSL).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="registering-velociraptor-as-an-oauth-application">Registering Velociraptor as an OAuth application&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The first step is to register Velociraptor as an OAuth app. We do this
by accessing the Google cloud console at
&lt;a href="https://console.cloud.google.com" target="_blank" >https://console.cloud.google.com&lt;/a>
 . You will need to set up a cloud
account first and create a cloud project. Although in this example we do
not necessarily need to host our application on Google cloud or have
anything to do with Google cloud, OAuth seems to exist within the Google
cloud product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our ultimate goal is to obtain OAuth credentials to give our
Velociraptor app, but we have to have a few things set up first. The
cloud console is fairly confusing so I usually use the search feature to
find exactly what I need. Searching for &amp;quot;oauth&amp;quot; at the search bar
indicates that it is under &amp;quot;APIs and Services&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to set up the OAuth consent screen first - in which we give our
application a name to be presented to the user by the OAuth flow:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="1.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further down we need to provide an authorized domain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="fb5c81ed3a220004b71069645f112867">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#fb5c81ed3a220004b71069645f112867" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/23/deploying_velociraptor_with_oauth_sso/2.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to add an Authorized domain we need to &lt;em>verify it&lt;/em>. Google's
help pages explain it further:&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices tip">
 &lt;div heading=" Authorized domains ">&lt;p>To protect you and your users, Google restricts your OAuth 2.0
application to using Authorized Domains. If you have verified the domain
with Google, you can use any Top Private Domain as an Authorized Domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>And this links to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home" target="_blank" >https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home&lt;/a>
 which
again seems completely unrelated to OAuth, Velociraptor or even a web
app (the web masters product is supposed to help sites increase their
search presence).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within this product we now need to &amp;quot;Add a property&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="10fb15c77258a991b0028080a64fb42d">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#10fb15c77258a991b0028080a64fb42d" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/23/deploying_velociraptor_with_oauth_sso/3.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="3.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hidden within the settings menu there is an option &amp;quot;Verification
Details&amp;quot; which allows you to verify that you own the domain. If you
purchased your domain from Google Domains then it should already be
verified - otherwise you can set some TXT records to prove you own the
domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="09dd8c2662b96ce14928333f055c5580">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#09dd8c2662b96ce14928333f055c5580" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/23/deploying_velociraptor_with_oauth_sso/4.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="4.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all this we can go back to the cloud console and Create
Credentials/OAuth client ID:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="8266e4bfeda1bd42d8f9794eb4ea0a13">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#8266e4bfeda1bd42d8f9794eb4ea0a13" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/23/deploying_velociraptor_with_oauth_sso/5.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="5.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now select &amp;quot;Web App&amp;quot; and we must set the &amp;quot;Authorized redirect URIs&amp;quot;
to &lt;a href="https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com/auth/google/callback" target="_blank" >https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com/auth/google/callback&lt;/a>

-This is the URL that successful OAuth authentication will direct to.
Velociraptor accepts this redirect and uses it to log the user on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="f19c9085129709ee14d013be869df69b">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#f19c9085129709ee14d013be869df69b" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/23/deploying_velociraptor_with_oauth_sso/6.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="6.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>The UI is a bit confusing here - you must press enter after typing the
redirect URL to have it registered &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong> you hit &lt;em>Create&lt;/em> otherwise
it misses that you typed it completely. I spent some time stumped on
this UI bug.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>If all goes well the Google cloud console will give us a client ID and a
client secret. We can then copy those into the Velociraptor
configuration file under the GUI section:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">GUI:
 google_oauth_client_id: 1234xxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
 google_oauth_client_secret: qsadlkjhdaslkjasd
 public_url: https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com/

logging:
 output_directory: /var/log/velociraptor/
 separate_logs_per_component: true
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In the above config we also enabled logging (which is important for a
secure application!). The separate_logs_per_component option will
create a separate log file for the GUI, Frontend as well as important
Audit related events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we can start the Velociraptor frontend:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --config server.config.yaml frontend
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Connecting using the browser goes through the familiar OAuth flow and
arrives at this Velociraptor screen:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;img class="inline" src="7.png" />




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OAuth flow ensures the user's identity is correct but does not give
them permission to log into Velociraptor. Note that having an OAuth
enabled application on the web allows anyone with a Google identity to
authenticate to the application but the user is still required to be
authorized. We can see the following in the Audit logs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">{
 &amp;quot;level&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;error&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;GET&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;msg&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;User rejected by GUI&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;192.168.0.10:40570&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2018-12-21T18:17:47+10:00&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;mike@velocidex.com&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In order to authorize the user we must explicitly add them using the
velociraptor admin tool:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --config ~/server.config.yaml user add mike@velocidex.com
Authentication will occur via Google - therefore no password needs to be set.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that this time, Velociraptor does not ask for a password at all,
since authentication occurs using Google's SSO. If we hit refresh in
the browser we can now see the Velociraptor application:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="602e8f042f463dc47ebfdf6a94ed5a6d">

 &lt;a class="image-link" href="8.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can see that the logged in user is authenticated by Google, and we
can also see their Google avatar at the top right for some more eye
candy :-).&lt;/p>

For a
simple deployment we can have Velociraptor server and clients
provisioned in minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually we deploy a specific Velociraptor deployment on our DFIR
engagements. We use cloud resources to provision the server and have the
clients connect to this cloud VM. A proper secure deployment of
Velociraptor will use SSL for securing both client communication and
protecting the web GUI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past provisioning an SSL enabled web application was complex and
expensive - you had to create certificate signing requests, interact
with a CA. Pay for the certificates, then configure the server. In
particular you had to remember to renew the cert in 2 years or your
website suddenly broke!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those days are over with the emergence of Lets Encrypt! and autocert.
These days applications can automatically provision their own
certificates. Velociraptor can manage its own certificates, fully
automatically - and then renew its certificates when the time comes with
no user intervention required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post we will see how to configure a new Velociraptor server
in a cloud VM.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="setting-up-a-domain">Setting up a domain&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The first step in deploying an SSL enabled web application is to have a
domain name. SSL verifies the authenticity of a web site by its DNS
name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We go over to Google Domains and buy a domain. In this post I will be
using the domain rekall-innovations.com.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="provisioning-a-virtual-machine">Provisioning a Virtual Machine&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Next we provision an Ubuntu VM from any cloud provider. Depending on
your deployment size your VM should be large enough. An 8 or 16Gb VM
should be sufficient for around 5-10k clients. Additionally we will need
sufficient disk space to hold the data we will collect. We recommend to
start with a modest amount of storage and then either backup data as it
gets collected or increase the storage volume as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our virtual machine will receive connections over ports 80 and 443.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When using SSL both the client communication &lt;em>and&lt;/em> the GUI are served
over the same ports to benefit from SSL transport encryption.
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we deploy our Virtual Machine we may choose either a static IP
address or allow the cloud provider to assign a dynamic IP address. We
typically choose a dynamic IP address and so we need to configure
Dynamic DNS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to the Google Domains dashboard and create a new dynamic DNS for your
domain. In our example we will use velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com
as our endpoint address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="1.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the dynamic address is created, we can get the credentials for
updating the IP address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="fb5c81ed3a220004b71069645f112867">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#fb5c81ed3a220004b71069645f112867" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next we install ddclient on our VM. This will update our dynamic IP
address whenever the external interface changes. Configure the file
`/etc/ddclient.conf`:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">protocol=dyndns2
use=web
server=domains.google.com
ssl=yes
login=X13342342XYZ
password='slk43521kj'
velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next configure the service to start:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode"># Configuration for ddclient scripts
# generated from debconf on Tue Oct 23 20:25:23 AEST 2018
#
# /etc/default/ddclient

# Set to &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if ddclient should be run every time DHCP client ('dhclient'
# from package isc-dhcp-client) updates the systems IP address.
run_dhclient=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;

# Set to &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if ddclient should be run every time a new ppp connection is
# established. This might be useful, if you are using dial-on-demand.
run_ipup=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;

# Set to &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if ddclient should run in daemon mode
# If this is changed to true, run_ipup and run_dhclient must be set to false.
run_daemon=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;

# Set the time interval between the updates of the dynamic DNS name in seconds.
# This option only takes effect if the ddclient runs in daemon mode.
daemon_interval=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Run dhclient and check that it updates the address correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="configuring-velociraptor-for-ssl">Configuring Velociraptor for SSL&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now comes the hard part! We need to configure Velociraptor to use SSL.
Edit the following in your server.config.yaml file (if you do not have
one yet you can generate one using velociraptor config
generate &amp;gt; server.config.yaml ):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Client:
 server_urls:
 - https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com/

autocert_domain: velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com
autocert_cert_cache: /etc/velociraptor_cache/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The autocert_domain parameter tells Velociraptor to provision its own
cert for this domain automatically. The certificates will be stored in
the directory specified by autocert_cert_cache. You don't have to
worry about rotating the certs, Velociraptor will automatically renew
them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously now the clients need to connect to the control channel over
SSL so we also need to direct the client's server_urls parameter to
the SSL port.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start the frontend (We need to start Velociraptor as root because
it must be able to bind to port 80 and 443):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ sudo velociraptor --config server.config.yaml frontend -v

[INFO] 2018-12-22T17:12:42+10:00 Loaded 43 built in artifacts

[INFO] 2018-12-22T17:12:42+10:00 Frontend is ready to handle client requests using HTTPS
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If all goes well we now can point our browser to
&lt;a href="https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com/" target="_blank" >https://velociraptor.rekall-innovations.com/&lt;/a>
 and it should just work.
Don't forget to provision a user and password using:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --config server.config.yaml user add mic
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="notes">Notes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The autocert configuration is very easy to do but there are a few
caveats:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Both ports 80 and 443 must be accessible over the web. This is
needed because Letsencrypt's servers need to connect to our domain
name in order to verify our domain ownership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is not possible to change the ports from port 80 and 443 due to
limitations in Letsencrypt's ACME protocol. This is why we can not
have more than one Velociraptor deployment on the same IP currently.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We have seen how easy it is to deploy secure Velociraptor servers. In
the next post we will discuss how to enhance security further by
deploying two factor authentication with Google's Single Sign On (SSO).&lt;/p>

points using Velociraptor artifacts. These artifacts encapsulate user
created queries using the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL). The power
of VQL is that it provides for a very flexible way of specifying exactly
what should be collected from the client and how - without needing to
modify client code or deploy new clients!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not the whole story though! It is also possible to run VQL
queries on the server side! Similarly server side Velociraptor artifacts
can be used to customize the operation of the server -without modifying
any code or redeploying the server components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="server-side-vql-queries">Server Side VQL Queries.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>By now you are probably familiar with Velociraptor and VQL. We have seen
that it is possible to run a VQL query interactively from the
commandline. For example to find all processes matching the 'gimp':&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query \
 &amp;quot;SELECT Pid, Exe, Cmdline FROM pslist() WHERE Exe =~ 'gimp'&amp;quot;
[
 {
 &amp;quot;Cmdline&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;gimp-2.10&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;Exe&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/usr/bin/gimp-2.10&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;Pid&amp;quot;: 13207
 }
]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We have used this feature previously in order to perfect and test our
queries by interactively building the query as we go along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However it is also possible to run queries on the server itself in order
to collect information about the server. There is nothing special about
this as such - it is simply that some VQL plugins are able to operate on
the server's internal data store and therefore provide a way to
interact with the server via VQL queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other endpoint monitoring tools export a rich API and even an API client
library to enable users to customize and control their installation. For
example, GRR expects users write python scripts using the GRR client API
library.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor's approach is different - the functionality typically
available via APIs is made available to VQL queries via VQL plugins
(e.g. client information, flow information and results collected). In
this way the VQL itself forms an API with which one controls the server
and deployment. There is no need to write any code - simply use existing
VQL plugins in any combination that makes sense to create new
functionality - then encapsulates these queries inside Velociraptor
artifacts for reuse and sharing.
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, to see all the clients and their hostnames:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query \
 &amp;quot;SELECT os_info.fqdn as Hostname, client_id from clients()&amp;quot; --format text
+-----------------+--------------------+
| Hostname | client_id |
+-----------------+--------------------+
| mic-Inspiron | C.772d16449719317f |
| TestComputer | C.11a3013cca8f826e |
| trek | C.952156a4b022ddee |
| DESKTOP-IOME2K5 | C.c916a7e445eb0868 |
+-----------------+--------------------+
SELECT os_info.fqdn AS Hostname,
client_id FROM clients()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To inspect what flows were run on a client:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query \
 &amp;quot;SELECT runner_args.creator, runner_args.flow_name, \
 runner_args.start_time FROM \
 flows(client_id='C.772d16449719317f')&amp;quot;
[
{
 &amp;quot;runner_args.creator&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;runner_args.flow_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;MonitoringFlow&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;runner_args.start_time&amp;quot;: 1544338661236625
},
{
 &amp;quot;runner_args.creator&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;mic&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;runner_args.flow_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;VFSDownloadFile&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;runner_args.start_time&amp;quot;: 1544087705756469
},
...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="client-event-monitoring">Client Event Monitoring&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We have also previously seen that Velociraptor can collect event streams
from clients. For example, the client's process execution logs can be
streamed to the server. Clients can also receive event queries which
forward selected events from the windows event logs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we covered those features in earlier blog posts, we stressed that
the Velociraptor server does not actually do anything with the client
events, other than save them to a file. The server just writes the
client's events in simple Comma Separated files (CSV files) on the
server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We mentioned that it is possible to import this file into another tool
(e.g. a spreadsheet or database) for post-processing. An alternative is
to perform post-processing with Velociraptor itself using server side
VQL queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, we can filter a client's process execution log using a VQL
query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query &amp;quot;SELECT * from monitoring(
 client_id='C.87b19dba006fcddb',
 artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation')
 WHERE Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc' &amp;quot;
[

]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The above query finds running instances of psexec's service component -
a popular method of lateral movement and privilege escalation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This query uses the monitoring() VQL plugin which opens each of the CSV
event monitoring logs for the specified artifact on the server, decodes
the CSV file and emits all the rows within it into the VQL Query. The
rows are then filtered by applying the regular expression to the name.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="server-side-event-queries">Server side event queries&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>VQL queries do not have to terminate at all. Some VQL plugins can run
indefinitely, emitting rows at random times - usually in response to
some events. These are called Event Queries since they never terminate.
We saw this property when monitoring the client - the above
Windows.Events.ProcessCreation artifact uses an event query which emits
a single row for each process execution on the end point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we can also have Event Queries on the server. When used in this
way the query triggers in response to data collected by the server of
various clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, consider the above query to detect instances of psexec
executions. While we can detect this by filtering existing monitoring
event logs, it would be nice to be able to respond to such an event
dynamically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way is to repeatedly run the same query (say every minute) and look
for newly reported instances of psexec executions. But this approach is
not terribly efficient. A better approach is to install a watcher on the
monitoring event log:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query &amp;quot;SELECT * from watch_monitoring(
 client_id='C.87b19dba006fcddb',
 artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation') where Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc' &amp;quot;
[
 {
 &amp;quot;CommandLine&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;\&amp;quot;C:\\\\Windows\\\\PSEXESVC.exe\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;Name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;\&amp;quot;PSEXESVC.exe\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,

 &amp;quot;artifact&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Windows.Events.ProcessCreation&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;client_id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;C.87b19dba006fcddb&amp;quot;
 }
]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The watcher efficiently follows the monitoring CSV file to detect new
events. These events are then emitted into the VQL query and
subsequently filtered. When the query processes all rows in the file,
the plugin just sleeps and waits for the file to grow again. The
watch_monitoring() plugin essentially tails the CSV file as it is being
written. Note that due to the fact that log files are never truncated
and always grow, and that CSV file format is a simple, one row per line
format it is possible to both read and write to the same file without
locking. This makes following a growing log file extremely efficient and
safe - even from another process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="responding-to-server-side-events">Responding to server side events&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The previous query will return a row when psexec is run on the client.
This is a very suspicious event in our environment and we would like to
escalate this by sending us an email.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can modify the above query to send an email for each event:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT * FROM foreach(
 row={
 SELECT * from watch_monitoring(
 client_id='C.87b19dba006fcddb',
 artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation')
 WHERE Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc'
 },
 query={
 SELECT * FROM mail(
 to='admin@example.com',
 subject='PsExec launched on host',
 period=60,
 body=format(format='PsExec execution detected at %v: %v',
 args=[Timestamp, Commandline])
 )
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The query sends an email from each event emitted. The message body is
formatted using the format() VQL function and this includes important
information from the generated event. Note that the mail() plugin
restricts the frequency of mails to prevent triggering the mail
server's spam filters. So if two psexec executions occur within 60
seconds we will only get one email.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for Velociraptor to be able to send mail you must configure
SMTP parameters in the server's configuration file. The following
example uses gmail to send mails (other mail providers will have similar
authentication requirements).&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Mail:
 server: &amp;quot;smtp.gmail.com&amp;quot;
 auth_username: someuser@gmail.com
 auth_password: zldifhjsdflkjfsdlie
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The password in the configuration is an application specific password
obtained from
&lt;a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords" target="_blank" >https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As always we really want to encapsulate VQL queries in artifact
definitions. This way we can design specific alerts, document them and
invoke them by name. Let us encapsulate the above queries in a new
artifact:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Server.Alerts.PsExec

 )
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We create a new directory called my_artifact_directory and store that

collector and instruct it to also add our private artifacts:&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This blog post demonstrates how VQL can be used on the server to create
a full featured incident response framework. Velociraptor does not
dictate a particular workflow, since all its actions are governed by VQL
queries and artifacts. Using the same basic building blocks, users can
fashion their own highly customized incident response workflow. Here is
a brainstorm of possible actions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An artifact can be written to automatically collect a memory capture
if a certain event is detected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the http_client() VQL plugin, when certain events are
detected on the server open a ticket automatically (using a SOAP or
JSON API).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a particular event is detected, immediately shut the machine down
or quarantine it (by running shell commands on the compromised
host).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The possibilities are truly endless. Comment below if you have more
interesting ideas and do not hesitate to contribute artifact definitions
to address your real world use cases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More on client event collection</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/09/more_on_client_event_collection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/12/09/more_on_client_event_collection/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="periodic-event-queries">Periodic Event queries&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The simplest kind of events are periodically generated events. These are
created using the clock() VQL plugin. This is a simple event plugin
which just emits a new row periodically.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query &amp;quot;select Unix from clock(period=5)&amp;quot; --max_wait 1
[
 {
 &amp;quot;Unix&amp;quot;: 1544339715
 }
][
 {
 &amp;quot;Unix&amp;quot;: 1544339720
 }
]^C
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The query will never terminate, instead the clock() plugin will emit a
new timestamp every 5 seconds. Note the --max_wait flag which tells
Velociraptor to wait at least for 1 second in order to batch rows before
reporting them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This query is not very interesting! Let's do something more
interesting. GRR has a feature where each client sends its own CPU use
and memory footprint sampled every minutes to the server. This is a
really useful feature because it can be used to make sure the client's
impact on the host's performance is minimal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us implement the same feature with a VQL query. What we want is to
measure the client's footprint every minute and send that to the
server:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT * from foreach(
 row={
 SELECT UnixNano FROM clock(period=60)
 },
 query={
 SELECT UnixNano / 1000000000 as Timestamp,
 Times.user + Times.system as CPU,
 MemoryInfo.RSS as RSS
 FROM pslist(pid=getpid())
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This query runs the clock() VQL plugin and for each row it emits, we run
the pslist() plugin, extracting the total CPU time (system + user) used
by our own pid (i.e. the Velociraptor client).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can now encapsulate this query in an
&lt;a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/reference/artifacts.html#generic-client-stats" >artifact&lt;/a>
 and
collect it:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor artifacts collect Generic.Client.Stats --max_wait 1 --format json
[][
 {
 &amp;quot;CPU&amp;quot;: 0.06999999999999999,

 }

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must specify the --format json to be able to see the results from
event queries on the command line. Otherwise Velociraptor will try to
get all the results so it can format them in a table and never return
any results.
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="installing-the-event-collector">Installing the event collector.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In order to have clients collect this event, we need to add the artifact
to the server. Simply add the YAML file into a directory on the server
and start the server with the --definitions flag. Then simply add the
event name to the Events clause of the server configuration. When
clients connect to the server they will automatically start collecting
these events and sending them to the server:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --definitions path/to/my/artifacts/ frontend
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Events:
 artifacts:
 - Generic.Client.Stats
 version: 2
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that we do not need to redeploy any clients, modify any code or
recompile anything. We simply add the new artifact definition and
clients will automatically start monitoring and feeding back our
information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data is sent to the server where it is stored in a file (Events are
stored in a unique file for each day).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the path
/var/lib/velociraptor/clients/C.772d16449719317f/monitoring/Artifact%20Generic.Client.Stats/2018-12-10
stores all events collected from client id C.772d16449719317f for the
Generic.Client.Stats artifact on the day of 2018-12-10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next blog post we will demonstrate how these events can be post
processed and acted on. It is important to note that the Velociraptor
server does not interpret the collected monitoring events at all -they
are simply appended to the daily log file (which is a CSV file).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CSV file can then be imported into basically any tool designed to
work with tabular data (e.g. spreadsheets, databases, BigQuery etc). CSV
is almost universally supported by all major systems.&lt;/p>

Recording end point event information on
the server gives a bunch of advantages. For one, the server keeps a
record of historical events, which makes going back to search for these
easy as part of an incident response activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, Velociraptor can keep a running log of process execution
events for all clients, on the server. If a particular executable is
suspected to be malicious, we can now go back and search for the
execution of that process in the past on the infected machine (for
establishing the time of infection), as well as search the entire
deployment base for the same binary execution to be able identify
lateral movement and wider compromises.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-are-events-monitored">How are events monitored?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Velociraptor relies heavily on VQL queries. A VQL query typically
produces a single table of multiple rows. For example, the query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT Name, CommandLine FROM pslist()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Returns a single row of all running processes, and then returns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, VQL queries do not have to terminate at all. If the VQL plugin
they are calling does not terminate, the VQL query will continue to run
and pass events in partial results to the VQL caller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Event queries are just regular VQL queries which do not terminate
(unless cancelled) returning rows whenever an event is generated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;img class="inline" src="1.png" />




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the parse_evtx() plugin. This plugin parses an event log file
and returns all events in it. We can then filter events and return
specific events of interest. The following query returns all the service
installation events and terminates:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe query &amp;quot;SELECT EventData, System.TimeCreated.SystemTime from
 parse_evtx(filename='c:/windows/system32/winevt/logs/system.evtx') where
 System.EventId.value = '7045'&amp;quot;
[
 {
 &amp;quot;EventData&amp;quot;: {
 &amp;quot;AccountName&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;ImagePath&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;system32\\DRIVERS\\VBoxGuest.sys&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;ServiceName&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;VirtualBox Guest Driver&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;ServiceType&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kernel mode driver&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;StartType&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;boot start&amp;quot;
 },
 &amp;quot;System.TimeCreated.SystemTime&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2018-11-10T06:32:34Z&amp;quot;
 }
]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The query specifically looks at the 7045 event &lt;a href="http://www.eventid.net/display.asp?eventid=7045&amp;amp;source=service&amp;#43;control&amp;#43;manager" target="_blank" >&amp;quot;A service was
installed in the
system&amp;quot;&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets turn this query into an event query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe query &amp;quot;SELECT EventData, System.TimeCreated.SystemTime from
 watch_evtx(filename='c:/windows/system32/winevt/logs/system.evtx') where
 System.EventId.value = '7045'&amp;quot; --max_wait 1
[
 &amp;quot;EventData&amp;quot;: {
 &amp;quot;AccountName&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;ImagePath&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;C:\\Users\\test\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pmeFF0E.tmp&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;ServiceName&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;pmem&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;ServiceType&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kernel mode driver&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;StartType&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;demand start&amp;quot;
 },
 &amp;quot;System.TimeCreated.SystemTime&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2018-11-10T04:57:35Z&amp;quot;
 }
]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The watch_evtx() plugin is the event watcher equivalent of the
parse_evtx() plugin. If you ran the above query, you will notice that
Velociraptor does not terminate. Instead it will show all existing
service installation events in the log file, and then just wait in the
console.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you then install a new service (in another terminal), for example
using winpmem.exe -L, a short time later you should see the event
reported by Velociraptor as in the above example. You will notice that
the watch_evtx() plugin emits event logs as they occur, but
Velociraptor will try to group the events into batches. The max_wait
flag controls how long to wait before releasing a partial result set.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="employing-event-queries-for-client-monitoring">Employing event queries for client monitoring&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The above illustrates how event queries work, but to actually be able to
use these we had to implement the Velociraptor event monitoring
framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally, when we launch a &lt;code>CollectVQL&lt;/code> flow, the client executes the
query and returns the result to the flow. Clearly since event queries
never terminate, we can not run them in series (because the client will
never be able to do anything else). The Velociraptor client has a table
of executing event queries which are run in a separate thread. As these
queries return more results, the results are sent back to the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also wanted to be able to update the events the clients are
monitoring on the fly (without a client restart). Therefore we needed a
way to be able to update the client's event table. This simply cancels
current event queries, and installs new queries in their place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 &lt;a class="image-link" href="2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As events are generated by the Event Table, they are sent back to the
server into the Monitoring flow. This flow is automatically created for
each client. The monitoring flow simply writes events into the client's
VFS. Therefore, events are currently simply recorded for each client. In
future there will be a mechanism to post process event and produce
alerts based on these.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="process-execution-logs">Process Execution logs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the most interesting event plugins is the WMI eventing plugin.
This allows Velociraptor to install a temporary WMI event listener. For
example, we can install a listener for new process creation:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">// Convert the timestamp from WinFileTime to Epoch.
SELECT timestamp(epoch=atoi(
 string=Parse.TIME_CREATED) / 10000000 - 11644473600 ) as Timestamp,
 Parse.ParentProcessID as PPID,
 Parse.ProcessID as PID,
 Parse.ProcessName as Name, {
 SELECT CommandLine
 FROM wmi(
 query=&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE ProcessID = &amp;quot; +
 format(format=&amp;quot;%v&amp;quot;, args=Parse.ProcessID),
 namespace=&amp;quot;ROOT/CIMV2&amp;quot;)
 } AS CommandLine
 FROM wmi_events(
 query=&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 1 WHERE
 TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'&amp;quot;,
 wait=5000000, // Do not time out.
 namespace=&amp;quot;ROOT/CIMV2&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The wmi_events() plugin installs an event listener into WMI and
therefore receives events from the OS about new process creation events.
Unfortunately these events, do not contain a lot of information about
the process. They only provide the ProcessID but not the full command
line. The above query executes a second subquery to retrieve the command
line for the process. We also parse the timestamp and convert it into a
more standard epoch based timestamp.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="specifying-what-should-the-client-monitor">Specifying what should the client monitor&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We have seen how Event VQL queries can generate events for the server.
However, this is difficult for Velociraptor's end users to directly
use. Who can really remember the full query?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we have shown previously, Velociraptor's Artifacts are specifically
designed to solve this issue. Artifacts encapsulate a VQL query so it
can be called by name alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the Windows.Events.ProcessCreation artifact encapsulates
the above query in one easy to remember name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To specify what clients should collect, users simply need to name the
event artifacts that should be monitored. Currently this is done in the
server configuration (in future this may be done via the GUI).&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Events:
 artifacts:
 - Windows.Events.ServiceCreation
 - Windows.Events.ProcessCreation
 version: 1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The event table version should be incremented each time the monitored
event list is updated. This forces all clients to refresh their event
tables.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-does-it-look-like-in-the-gui">How does it look like in the GUI?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Monitoring flow simply writes files into the client's VFS. This
allows these to be downloaded and post processed outside of
Velociraptor.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Adding event monitoring to Velociraptor is a great step forward. Even
just keeping the logs around is extremely helpful for incident response.
There is a lot of value in things like process execution logging, and
remote event log forwarding. We will cover some more examples of event
log monitoring in future blog posts. Until then, have a play and provide
feedback as usual by filing issues and feature requests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Velociraptor's filesystem's accessors</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/30/velorciraptor_s_filesystem_s_accessors/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/30/velorciraptor_s_filesystem_s_accessors/</guid><description>&lt;p>In addition, Velociraptor can now also read &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/vss/volume-shadow-copy-service-portal" target="_blank" >Volume Shadow

snapshots. The gives a kind of time-machine ability to allow the
investigator to look through the drive content at a previous point in
the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post introduces the new features and describe how
Velociraptor's filesystem accessors work to provide data from multiple
sources to VQL queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have previously seen that Velociraptor can list and download files
from the client's filesystem, as well as registry keys and values. The
client's filesystem is made available to VQL plugins such as glob()
allowing many Artifacts to be written that work on files, registry keys
and raw NTFS volumes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Velociraptor is a great remote response tool, everything that it
can do remotely, it can also do locally using a command line interface.
This gives the user an opportunity to interactively test their VQL
queries while writing artifacts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The latest release adds a couple of convenient command line options
which allow the user to interact with the filesystem accessors. For
example, to list the files in a directory we can use the &amp;quot;velociraptor
fs ls&amp;quot; command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe fs ls

SELECT Name, Size, Mode.String AS Mode, timestamp(epoch=Mtime.Sec) AS mtime,
 Data FROM glob(globs=path, accessor=accessor)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The &amp;quot;fs ls&amp;quot; command instructs Velociraptor to list directories using
its internal filesystem accessors. By default it will use the &amp;quot;file&amp;quot;
accessor - which simply uses the usual Win32 api filesystem calls (i.e.
&lt;code>CreateFile&lt;/code>, &lt;code>FindFirstFile&lt;/code> etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On windows, the file accessor lists the drive letters at the root of the
filesystem, then allows subdirectories to be listed under each letter.
The above output shows some metadata for each drive letter (like its
size etc) and below the table we can see the VQL query that was used to
generate the table. To be clear, the &amp;quot;fs ls&amp;quot; command is simply a
shortcut for producing a VQL query that ultimately uses the filesystem
accessor in the glob() VQL plugin. Therefore, we can enter any glob
expression to find files:&lt;/p>

SELECT FullPath, Size, Mode.String AS Mode, timestamp(epoch=Mtime.Sec) AS mtime, Data FROM
glob(globs=path, accessor=accessor)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When using the registry filesystem accessor, the registry appears like a
filesystem, allowing us to run glob expressions against registry keys
and values (Note that the registry accessor provides the value in the
metadata):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe fs --accessor reg ls &amp;quot;HKEY_USERS\*\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\{Run,RunOnce}\*&amp;quot;

SELECT Name, Size, Mode.String AS Mode, timestamp(epoch=Mtime.Sec) AS mtime,
Data FROM glob(globs=path, accessor=accessor)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Finally, the NTFS accessor can access files by parsing the NTFS
filesystem directly. At the top level, the accessor shows all NTFS
formatted partitions. These include regular drives as well as Volume
Shadow Copies:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe fs --accessor ntfs ls

on two different dates (highlighted above). We can browse these

expressions to this path):&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Volume shadow copies are like a time machine - they can reveal data that
was stored on the drive days or weeks prior to the time we inspected it
which makes them very useful for some investigations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="using-filesystem-accessors-remotely---the-velociraptor-vfs">Using filesystem accessors remotely - The Velociraptor VFS&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The above description shows how Velociraptor's command line interface
can be used to interact with the various filesystem accessors. This is
important for writing and collecting artifacts for triage and general
system state exploration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, how do filesystem accessors appear in the Velociraptor GUI?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="14d5272720a30dc28bf2478f8352eec9">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#14d5272720a30dc28bf2478f8352eec9" class="figure">

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="vfs1.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nice thing about Velociraptor's GUI is that it is just a way to
present the same information that the &amp;quot;fs ls&amp;quot; command is getting by
using the same VQL queries. Therefore the view is very familiar:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The top level of the Velociraptor VFS represents all the filesystem
accessors implemented in the client.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of these accessors shows its own view:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The file accessor uses the OS APIs to list files and
directories. Its top level is a list of mounted drives (which
may be CDROM's or even network shares).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The NTFS accessor shows all NTFS volumes accessible, including
local drives and Volume Shadow Copies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The registry accessor uses Win32 APIs to access the registry and
shows at the top level a list of all system hives currently
attached.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each file listed, the accessor also includes a Data attribute.
This contains accessor specific metadata about the file (for example
the MFT entry).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In the below screenshot we can see how the user may navigate into the
Volume Shadow Copy and retrieve files from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="647959e2b58df8abee73b38074040e5a">

 image
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-note-about-filenames">A note about filenames.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>NTFS can have several different names to the same file. Typically, a
short DOS 8.3 style filename (e.g. &lt;code>PROGRA~1&lt;/code>), as well as a Win32 long
filename (e.g. Program Files). You can see the short name for a file
using the API GetShortPathName() (or the command &lt;code>dir /x&lt;/code>), but a program
needs to deliberately ask for it. Most programs do not explicitly
collect or show the short filename of a file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can cause problems for DFIR applications. For example, Imagine we
discovered a Run key to C:\\Users\\test\\runme.exe. If we only
considered the long filename (as for example returned by the Win32API
FindFile() or the output of the &lt;code>dir&lt;/code> command), then we would assume the
file has been removed and the run key is not active. In reality however,
the file may be called &amp;quot;This is some long filename.exe&amp;quot; with a DOS
name of &amp;quot;runme.exe&amp;quot;. Explorer (and most tools) will only show the long
filename by default, but the runkey will still execute by referring to
the DOS filename!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually the short filename is some variation of the long filename with a
~1 or ~2 at the end. In reality it can be anything. In the snippet
below, I am setting the short filename for the velociraptor.exe binary
to be something completely unrelated, then I am running the binary using
the unrelated filename:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">C:\Users\test&amp;gt;fsutil file setshortname velociraptor.exe runme.exe
C:\Users\test&amp;gt;dir /x *.exe
 Volume in drive C has no label.

An advanced incident response and monitoring agent.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can see that Windows explorer shows no trace of the runme.exe file
since it only displays the Win32 long file name:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="561d4d712c146a83dc618e64783f73f4">

 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is important for DFIR investigators to be aware of this and test your
tools! You can see that sysinternals' autoruns program won't have any
of these shenanigans when I added a runkey to &amp;quot;runme.exe&amp;quot;. It shows
the real filename velociraptor.exe even though the runkey indicates
runme.exe:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="647cdc90ba5d62a9c71f170ac4b17a0f">

&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor treats a file's DOS name and Win32 Name as distinct
entries in the NTFS directory listing. This allows us to find any
references to the file by it's DOS name as well as its Win32 name.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As Velociraptor gains more functionality, we envision more filesystem
accessors to become available. The nice thing about these accessors is
that they just slot in to the rest of the VQL plugins. By providing a
new accessor, we are able to glob, hash, yara scan etc the new
abstraction. For example, to yara scan a registry key one simply calls
the VQL plugin yara with an accessor of reg: yara(rules=myRules,
files=my_reg_keys, accessor=&amp;quot;reg&amp;quot;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Detecting powershell persistence with Velociraptor and Yara</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/29/detecting_powershell_persistence_with_velociraptor_and_yara/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/29/detecting_powershell_persistence_with_velociraptor_and_yara/</guid><description>

 &lt;div heading="warning">&lt;p>This page is written about a very old version of Velociraptor and is
retained for historical purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>I was watching the SANS DFIR Summit 2018 videos on YouTube and came
across Mari DeGrazia's talk titled &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC7fzhvAY8" target="_blank" >&amp;quot;Finding and Decoding Malicious
Powershell Scripts&amp;quot;&lt;/a>
. This
is an excellent talk and it really contains a wealth of information. It
seems that Powershell is really popular these days, allowing attacker to
&amp;quot;live off the land&amp;quot; by installing fully functional reverse shells and
backdoors, in a few lines of obfuscated scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mari went through a number of examples and also expanded on some in her
blog post &lt;a href="http://az4n6.blogspot.com/2018/06/malicious-powershell-in-registry.html" target="_blank" >Malicious PowerShell in the Registry:
Persistence&lt;/a>
,
where she documents persistence through an autorun key launching
powershell to execute a payload within another registry key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A similar persistence mechanism is documented by David Kennedy from
Binary defence in his post &lt;a href="https://blog.binarydefense.com/powershell-injection-diskless-persistence-bypass-techniques" target="_blank" >PowerShell Injection with Fileless Payload
Persistence and Bypass
Techniques&lt;/a>
.
In that case an msha.exe link was stored in the user's Run key which
executed a payload from another registry key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was eager to write a Velociraptor artifact to attempt to detect such
keys using a YARA signature. Of course signature based detection is not
as robust as behavioural analysis but it is quick and usually quite
effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it was still quite instructive to document how one can develop
the VQL queries for a simple Velociraptor artifact. We will be
developing the artifact interactively on a Windows system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Our artifact will attempt to detect the persistence mechanism detailed
in the above posts. We start by adding a value to our test user account
under the key&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Key: &amp;quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run&amp;quot;
Value: &amp;quot;C:\Windows\system32\mshta.exe&amp;quot;
Data:
 about:&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;c1hop=&amp;quot;X642N10&amp;quot;;R3I=new%20ActiveXObject(&amp;quot;WScript.Shell&amp;quot;);

 J7UuF1n=&amp;quot;Q2LnLxas&amp;quot;;eval(k9To7P);JUe5wz3O=&amp;quot;zSfmLod&amp;quot;;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="defining-the-artifact">Defining the Artifact.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We create a directory called &amp;quot;artifacts&amp;quot; then create a new file inside
it called powershell_persistence.yaml. Velociraptor artifacts are just
YAML files that can be loaded at runtime using the --definitions flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every artifact has a name, by convention the name is separated into its
major categories. We will call ours Windows.Persistence.Powershell:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Windows.Persistence.Powershell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This is the minimum required for Velociraptor to identify it. We can see
a listing of all artifacts Velociraptor knows about using the
&amp;quot;artifacts list&amp;quot; command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe --definitions artifacts artifacts list
INFO:2018/09/28 07:59:40 Loaded 34 built in artifacts
Linux.Applications.Chrome.Extensions
Linux.Applications.Chrome.Extensions.Upload
…
Windows.Persistence.Powershell
...
Windows.Sys.Users
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We can collect the artifact simply by using the &amp;quot;artifacts collect&amp;quot;
command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe --definitions artifacts artifacts collect Windows.Persistence.Powershell
INFO:2018/09/28 20:01:32 Loaded 34 built in artifacts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Ok so Velociraptor can load and collect this new artifact, but as yet it
does nothing! We need to think about what exactly we want to collect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We know we want to search for all values in the Run/RunOnce hive of all
the users. Let's first see if we can retrieve all the values using a
glob:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Windows.Persistence.Powershell
parameters:
 - name: keyGlob
 default: &amp;quot;HKEY_USERS\\*\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\
 \\CurrentVersion\\{Run,RunOnce}\\*&amp;quot;
sources:
 - precondition:
 SELECT OS from info() where OS = &amp;quot;windows&amp;quot;
 queries:
 - |
 SELECT FullPath from glob(
 globs=keyGlob,
 accessor=&amp;quot;reg&amp;quot;
 )
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This artifact demonstrates a few concepts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We can define parameters by name, and reference them from within the
VQL query. This keeps the VQL query clean and more readable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can define a precondition on the artifact. If the precondition is
not met, the VQL query will not be run.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Lets run this artifact:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe --definitions artifacts artifacts collect Windows.Persistence.Powershell

Artifact:
Windows.Persistence.Powershell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It returns a couple of results so there are two Run/RunOnce values
defined. For this artifact, we only want to return those entries which
match a specific yara signature. We can work later on improving the yara
signature, but for now let's just detect uses of the eval() powershell
command within 500 characters of an ActiveXObject instantiation. We will
try to match each value returned from the Run keys with this object:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Windows.Persistence.Powershell
parameters:
 - name: keyGlob
 default: &amp;quot;HKEY_USERS\\*\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\

 - name: yaraRule

 rule Powershell {
 strings:
 $ = /ActiveXObject.{,500}eval/ nocase
 $ = /ActiveXObject.{,500}eval/ wide nocase
 condition:
 any of them
 }
sources:
 - precondition:
 SELECT OS from info() where OS = &amp;quot;windows&amp;quot;
 queries:
 - |
 // This is a stored query
 LET file = SELECT FullPath from glob(
 globs=keyGlob,

 )
 - |
 SELECT * FROM yara(
 rules=yaraRule,
 files=file.FullPath, // This will expand to a list of paths.
 accessor=&amp;quot;reg&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This version recovers the FullPath of all the Run/RunOnce values and
stores them in a stored query. We then issue another query that applies
the yara rule on these values:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We can see that the last query returns 5 columns, but each column
actually contains objects with quite a lot of additional information.
For example, the File column returns information about the file that
matched the yara rule (its filename, timestamps etc). The output is a
bit confusing so we just return the relevant columns. We can replace the
* in the last query with a curated list of columns to return:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT File.FullPath as ValueName, File.Data.value as Contents,
 timestamp(epoch=File.Mtime.Sec) as ModTime

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is that? Experienced incident responders would recognize that any
artifact that works from the &lt;code>HKEY_USERS&lt;/code> registry hive is inherently
unreliable. This is because the &lt;code>HKEY_USERS&lt;/code> hive is not a real hive -it
is a place where Windows mounts the user's hive when the user logs in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-hkey_users-hive-work">How does &lt;code>HKEY_USERS&lt;/code> hive work?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Windows implements the concept of user profiles. Each user has a
personal registry hive that stores user specific settings. It is
actually a file stored on their home directory called ntuser.dat. When a
user logs into the workstation, the file may be synced from the domain
controller and then it is mounted under the &lt;code>HKEY_USERS\&amp;lt;sid&amp;gt;&lt;/code>
registry hive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that when the user logs out, their user registry hive is
unmounted and does not appear in &lt;code>HKEY_USERS&lt;/code> any longer. Any artifacts
based around the &lt;code>HKEY_USERS&lt;/code> hive will work only if the collection is
run when a user is logged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is obviously not what we want when we hunt for persistence! We want
to make sure that none of the users on the system have this persistence
mechanism installed. You can imagine a case where a system has been
cleaned up but then a user logs into the machine, thereby reinfecting
it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-fix-this">How to fix this?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yara is a very powerful tool because it allows us to search for patterns
in amorphous data (such as process memory and structured files) without
having to fully understand the structure of the data we are searching
for. Of course this has its limitations, but yara can raise a red flag
if the signature matches the file, and we can analyse this file more
carefully later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case, we can not rely on globbing the &lt;code>HKEY_USER&lt;/code> registry hive,
so maybe we can just search the files that back these hives? We know
that each user on the system has an NTUSER.DAT file in their home
directory (usually C:\\Users\\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;), so let's write an
artifact to find these files. We can reuse the artifact
Windows.Sys.Users that reports all user accounts on a system (we display
it as JSON to enhance readability):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">F:\&amp;gt;velociraptor.exe artifacts collect Windows.Sys.Users --format json

 &amp;quot;Uid&amp;quot;: 1003
},
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So we just want to YARA scan the NTUSER.DAT file in each home directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT * from foreach(
row={
 SELECT Name, Directory as HomeDir
 FROM Artifact.Windows.Sys.Users()
 WHERE Directory.value and Gid
},
query={
 SELECT File.FullPath As FullPath,
 Strings.Offset AS Off,
 Strings.HexData As Hex,
 upload(file=File.FullPath, accessor=&amp;quot;ntfs&amp;quot;) AS Upload
 FROM yara(
 files=&amp;quot;\\\\.\\&amp;quot; + HomeDir + &amp;quot;\\ntuser.dat&amp;quot;,
 accessor=&amp;quot;ntfs&amp;quot;,
 rules=yaraRule, context=10)
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This query:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Selects all the usernames and their home directory from the
Windows.Sys.Users artifact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each directory prepends \\\\.\\ and appends
&amp;quot;ntuser.dat&amp;quot;. For example c:\\Users\\test becomes
\\\\.\\c:\\Users\\test\\NTUSER.dat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The file is accessed using the NTFS filesystem accessor. This is
necessary because the registry hive is locked if the user is logged
in. Therefore we must access it using raw NTFS parsing to bypass the
OS locking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each file that matches the yara expression, we upload the file
to the server for further analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Lets run this new artifact on the server:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike the previous artifact, this one simply returns the YARA hit, but
because we do not have any context on which value contained the
signature, or even if it had been deleted. Luckily we uploaded the raw
registry hive for further analysis, and we can use a tool such as
RegRipper to extract more information from the hive:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this blog post we saw how to utilize YARA to find suspicious
powershell persistence mechanisms. YARA is a powerful tool and using
Velociraptor's artifacts we can apply it to files, registry values, and
raw NTFS files such as locked registry hives and the pagefile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also saw some of the inherent problems with relying on the
&lt;code>HKEY_USERS&lt;/code> registry hive for detection - the hive is only present when
a user is logged in so when we hunt, we might miss those users who are
currently logged out. We saw how YARA can be used to detect suspicious
patterns in raw registry hive files and how artifacts may retrieve those
files for further analysis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Velociraptor walk through and demo</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/03/velociraptor_walk_through_and_demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/09/03/velociraptor_walk_through_and_demo/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just uploaded a screencast of the latest Velociraptor - check it out

When we first started writing endpoint
monitoring tools (With GRR then Rekall Agent) we implemented the ability
to collect files, registry keys and other data. If an analyst wanted to
collect, say the chrome extensions, they would need to know where chrome
extensions typically reside (
&lt;code>%homedir%/.config/google-chrome/Extensions/**&lt;/code>) and enter that in each
time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We soon realized this was error prone and required too much mental
overhead for analysts to constantly remember these details. GRR inspired
the creation of the Forensic Artifacts project. It was created in order
to solve the problem of documenting and sharing knowledge about forensic
evidence file and registry location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further, since GRR can only collect files and has limited parsing
support, the parsing and interpretation of the artifacts is not
specified. GRR Artifacts can only specify file sets (via globs),
registry key/value sets and collections of other artifacts. These are a
bit limited in their expressiveness, and so it means that GRR has to
augment forensic artifacts with a lot of GRR specific things (like post
processing, parsing etc) to make them useful. Although Forensic
Artifacts are supposed to be tool agnostic they carry over a lot of GRR
implementation details (e.g. the knowledge base interpolations, glob
patterns etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next came OSQuery with their SQL like syntax. This was a huge
advancement at the time because it allows users to customize the data
they obtained from their endpoint, and ask questions from the entire
enterprise at once. For the first time it was possible to combine data
from multiple sources (i.e. OSQuery &amp;quot;tables&amp;quot;) in an intelligent way
and customize the output to fit a processing pipeline, rather than write
a lot of interface glue code to filter and extract data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently OSQuery has grown many tables - each table typically
implements a specific parser to extract one set of data. In this sense
OSQuery also solves the same problem as GRR's artifacts - they provide
a single named entity (called a table in OSQuery) which produces results
about one type of thing (e.g. arp_cache table produces results about
the arp cache entries). The user can then just ask for the ARP cache and
doesn&amp;rsquo;t care how we get it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next logical development was the development of Velociraptor Query
Language (VQL). VQL is not pure SQL - instead it is an SQL like language
with a severely reduced feature set. The main difference with regular
SQL is the ability to provide arguments to table names - that is a VQL
plugin is a data source that can receive arbitrary arguments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This changes the entire game - since we can now provide high level
functions to control plugin execution. Combined with the VQL ability to
combine multiple queries into subqueries this opens the door for very
complex types of queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, consider the OSQuery users table. This table reads the
system's /etc/passwd file and parses out the different columns. It is
hard coded into the OSQuery binary. While this is a very simple table,
it shares its operation with many other similar tables. Other tables
open similar files, parse them line by line and return each field as the
query's columns. There are many similar files that contain useful
information on a system. If one was to add a parser for each one in
OSQuery, then they need to write a small amount of code, recompile the
binary and push it out to clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Re-deploying new code to endpoints is a difficult task in practice.
There is testing and release processes to employ. Furthermore if a local
modification is made to OSQuery one needs to submit PRs upstream,
otherwise the codebases may diverge and maintainance would be difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than have a built in plugin for each such table, Velociraptor
simply includes a number of generic parsers which may be reused for
parsing different files. For example, consider the following VQL Query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT User, Desc, Uid, Gid, Homedir, Shell FROM parse_records_with_regex(
 file=&amp;quot;/etc/passwd&amp;quot;,
 regex='(?m)^(?P&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;[^:]+):([^:]+):' +
 '(?P&amp;lt;Uid&amp;gt;[^:]+):(?P&amp;lt;Gid&amp;gt;[^:]+):(?P&amp;lt;Desc&amp;gt;[^:]*):' +
 '(?P&amp;lt;Homedir&amp;gt;[^:]+):(?P&amp;lt;Shell&amp;gt;[^:\\s]+)')
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>parse_records_with_regex()&lt;/code> plugin simply applies one or more regex
to a file and each match is sent as a record. In this case, each line is
matched and parsed into its components automatically. Note how the query
produces the same results as OSQuery's users table, but uses completely
generic parsers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The generic parser can be used to parse many other file types. Here is
query which parses debian apt-source lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT * FROM parse_records_with_regex(
 file=&amp;quot;/etc/apt/sources.list&amp;quot;,
 regex=&amp;quot;(?m)^ *(?P&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;deb(-src)?) &amp;quot;+
 &amp;quot;(?:\\[arch=(?P&amp;lt;Arch&amp;gt;[^\\]]+)\\] )?&amp;quot; +
 &amp;quot;(?P&amp;lt;URL&amp;gt;https?://(?P&amp;lt;base_uri&amp;gt;[^ ]+))&amp;quot; +
 &amp;quot; +(?P&amp;lt;components&amp;gt;.+)&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Having the ability to control parsing directly in the query opens up
many possibilities. What if we need to parse new files which do not have
an OSQuery parser yet (maybe an enterprise application configuration
file)? We can easily construct a query using the generic parsers and
issue it to the endpoint to support new file format.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="velociraptor-artifacts">Velociraptor Artifacts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the previous section we saw how we can express very complex queries
to support novel parsing scenarios. However it is hard for users to
directly issue the queries - who can remember this complex regex and
type it in every time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We clearly need some way to record the queries in a simple, reusable
way. This sounds a lot like GRR's Artifacts! What if we could just
write the complex query in a YAML file and then just said to
Velociraptor - go collect that artifact and the correct queries would be
issued to the client automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than try to make artifacts generic, we define Velociraptor
Artifacts as YAML files which simply bundle together a bunch of VQL
statements that together run a particular query. In a sense,
Velociraptor's artifacts are similar to OSQuery's table definition
(since they specify output columns), except they are defined completely
by the YAML definition file, using generic reusable VQL plugins, put
together with VQL queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example of the the Linux.Sys.Users artifact - this is the
equivalent artifact to OSQuery's users table:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">name: Linux.Sys.Users
description: Get User specific information like homedir, group etc from /etc/passwd.
parameters:
 - name: PasswordFile
 default: /etc/passwd
 description: The location of the password file.
sources:
 - precondition: |
 SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'linux'
 queries:
 - SELECT User, Desc, Uid, Gid, Homedir, Shell
 FROM parse_records_with_regex(
 file=PasswordFile,
 regex='(?m)^(?P&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;[^:]+):([^:]+):' +
 '(?P&amp;lt;Uid&amp;gt;[^:]+):(?P&amp;lt;Gid&amp;gt;[^:]+):(?P&amp;lt;Desc&amp;gt;[^:]*):' +
 '(?P&amp;lt;Homedir&amp;gt;[^:]+):(?P&amp;lt;Shell&amp;gt;[^:\\s]+)')
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The artifact has a specific name (Linux.Sys.Users) and a description.
The Artifact will only run if the precondition is satisfied (i.e. if we
are running on a linux system). Running the artifact locally produces
the following output:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor artifacts collect Linux.Sys.Users
+-------------------+-------------------------+-------+-------+--------------------------+
| USER | DESC | UID | GID | HOMEDIR |

| lp | lp | 7 | 7 | /var/spool/lpd |
| mail | mail | 8 | 8 | /var/mail |
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="why-would-i-want-to-use-artifacts">Why would I want to use Artifacts?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We just demonstrated that Velociraptor's artifact produces the same
output as OSQuery's users table - so what? Why use an artifact over
hard coding the table in the executable?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor is inherently a remote endpoint monitoring agent. Agents
are installed on many end points and once installed it is often
difficult to remotely update them. For various reasons, endpoints are
often difficult to upgrade - for example, they might be off the
corporate LAN, or have a broken update agent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, when responding to a major incident, we often have to
rapidly deploy a new hunt to search for an indicator of compromise. In
most cases we don't have time to go through proper software deployment
best practice and upgrade our endpoint agent in rapid succession (it
typically takes weeks to have endpoint agents upgraded).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Velociraptor's artifacts allow us to write a new type of
parser immediately since it is just a YAML file with VQL statements, we
can push it immediately to the clients with no code changes, rebuild, or
redeploy scripts. That is very powerful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not only can we add new artifacts, but we can adapt artifacts on the fly
to different systems - perhaps there is a slightly different version of
Linux which keeps files in different locations? Or maybe a slightly
different format of the file we are trying to parse. Being able to adapt
rapidly is critical.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="so-how-do-i-use-artifacts">So how do I use Artifacts?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Velociraptor exposes artifacts via two main mechanisms. The first is the
Artifact Collector flow. This flow presents a special GUI which allows
us to view the different artifacts, choose which ones we want to launch
and describes them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="b14314aebc4ff82283ec0de0ceaf9bab">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#b14314aebc4ff82283ec0de0ceaf9bab" class="figure">
 &lt;img src="https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/20/velociraptor_artifacts/artifacts_how_to.png" alt="">
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="artifacts_how_to.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we can see in the screenshot above, the artifact collector flow
allows the user to inspect the artifacts, before issuing the VQL to the
client. The responses are received by the server and displayed as part
of the same flow:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="c3e6bce599509357322bb76c7f211635">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#c3e6bce599509357322bb76c7f211635" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="artifacts2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a pretty easy set and forget type system. However, Velociraptor
makes artifacts available within any VQL query too. The artifact simply
appears as another VQL plugin. Consider the following VQL Query that
filters only user accounts which have a real shell:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor query --format text &amp;quot;SELECT * FROM Artifact.Linux.Sys.Users() where Shell =~ 'bash'&amp;quot;
+------+------+------+------+-----------+-----------+
| USER | DESC | UID | GID | HOMEDIR | SHELL |
+------+------+------+------+-----------+-----------+
| root | root | 0 | 0 | /root | /bin/bash |
| mic | | 1000 | 1000 | /home/mic | /bin/bash |
+------+------+------+------+-----------+-----------+
SELECT * FROM Artifact.Linux.Sys.Users() WHERE Shell =~ 'bash'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>An artifact definition can use other artifacts by simply issuing queries
against these artifact plugins. This forms a natural system of
interdependency between artifacts, and leads to artifact reuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-powerful-are-velociraptor-artifacts">How powerful are Velociraptor Artifacts?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Previously we described Velociraptor artifacts as having some properties
in common with GRR's artifacts (pure YAML, reusable and server side)
and OSQuery's tables (very detailed and potentially complex parsers,
directly using APIs and libraries). We said that Velociraptor attempts
to replace many of the specific &amp;quot;one artifact per table&amp;quot; model in
OSQuery with a set of YAML files referencing generic plugins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor's artifacts can never fully emulate all OSQuery's tables
because some OSQuery tables call specific APIs and have very complex
operation. However, most of OSQuery's tables are fairly simple and can
be easily emulated by Velociraptor artifacts. In this sense
-Velociraptor lies somewhere in between GRR's simple collect all files
and registry keys without parsing them, and OSQuery's specialized
parsers. However VQL is quite capable, as we shall see. Although we can
not implement all tables using pure VQL queries, the ability to
implement many artifacts this way provides us with unprecedented
flexibility and enables rapid response to evolving threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's looks at some artifacts that demonstrate this flexibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="parsing-debian-packages">Parsing debian packages.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Debian packages keep a manifest file with records delimited by an empty
line. Each record consists of possible fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">- LET packages = SELECT parse_string_with_regex(
 string=Record,
 regex=['Package:\\s(?P&amp;lt;Package&amp;gt;.+)',
 'Installed-Size:\\s(?P&amp;lt;InstalledSize&amp;gt;.+)',
 'Version:\\s(?P&amp;lt;Version&amp;gt;.+)',
 'Source:\\s(?P&amp;lt;Source&amp;gt;.+)',
 'Architecture:\\s(?P&amp;lt;Architecture&amp;gt;.+)']) as Record
 FROM parse_records_with_regex(
 file=linuxDpkgStatus,
 regex='(?sm)^(?P&amp;lt;Record&amp;gt;Package:.+?)\\n\\n')

- SELECT Record.Package as Package,
 Record.InstalledSize as InstalledSize, Record.Version as
 Version, Record.Source as Source, Record.Architecture as
 Architecture
 from packages
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The above query uses the parse_records_with_regex() plugin to split
the file into records (anything between the Package: and the next empty
line). Each record is then parsed separately using the
parse_string_with_regex() VQL function. Being able to parse in two
(or more) passes makes writing regexes much easier since they can be
simplified greatly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="complex-multi-query-example-chrome-extensions">Complex multi-query example: Chrome extensions.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An example of a sophisticated artifact is the chrome extensions
artifact. It implements the following algorithm:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>For each user on the system, locate all chrome extension manifest
files by using a glob expression.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parse the manifest file as JSON&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the manifest contains a &amp;quot;default_locale&amp;quot; item, then locate the
locale message file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parse the locale message file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extract the extension name - if the extension has default locale
then return the string from the locale file, otherwise from the
manifest file.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The full artifact is rather long so will not be listed here in full, but
are a couple of interesting VQL plugins which make writing artifacts
more powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The foreach() plugin runs a query and for each row produced, a second
query is run (with the first row present in the scope). This is similar
to SQL's JOIN operator but more readable. For example the following
query executes a glob on each user's home directory (as obtained from
the password file):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">LET extension_manifests = SELECT * from foreach(
 row={
 SELECT Uid, User, Homedir from Artifact.Linux.Sys.Users()
 },
 query={
 SELECT FullPath, Mtime, Ctime, User, Uid from glob(
 globs=Homedir + '/' + extensionGlobs)
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note how the query is assigned to the variable &amp;quot;extension_manifests&amp;quot;
which can be used as an input to other queries. The if() plugin
evaluates a condition (or a query) and runs the &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; query if true,
or the &amp;quot;else&amp;quot; query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">LET maybe_read_locale_file = SELECT * from if(
 condition={
 select * from scope() where Manifest.default_locale
 },
 query={
 SELECT Manifest, Uid, User, Filename as LocaleFilename,
 ManifestFilename, parse_json(data=Data) AS LocaleManifest
 FROM read_file(
 -- Munge the filename to get the messages.json path.
 filenames=regex_replace(
 source=ManifestFilename,
 replace=&amp;quot;/_locales/&amp;quot; + Manifest.default_locale + &amp;quot;/messages.json&amp;quot;,
 re=&amp;quot;/manifest.json$&amp;quot;))
 },
 else={
 -- Just fill in empty Locale results.
 SELECT Manifest, Uid, User, &amp;quot;&amp;quot; AS LocaleFilename, &amp;quot;&amp;quot; AS ManifestFilename,
 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; AS LocaleManifest FROM scope()
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="parsing-binary-data-wtmp-file-parser">Parsing binary data: Wtmp file parser.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is also possible to parse binary files with VQL. For example,
consider the wtmp file parser implemented in the Linux.Sys.LastUserLogin
artifact. This artifact uses the binary_parser() VQL plugin which
accepts a Rekall style profile string to instantiate an iterator over
the file. Since the wtmp file is simply a sequence of wtmp structs, we
can iterate over them in a query.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT * from foreach(
 row={
 SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=split(string=wtmpGlobs, sep=&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;))
 },
 query={
 SELECT ut_type, ut_id, ut_host as Host, ut_user as User,
 timestamp(epoch=ut_tv.tv_sec) as login_time
 FROM binary_parse(
 file=FullPath,
 profile=wtmpProfile,
 iterator=&amp;quot;Array&amp;quot;,
 Target=&amp;quot;wtmp&amp;quot;
 )
 })
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="the-future">The future&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We started implementing many of the simpler OSQuery tables using VQL.
For the remaining tables (the ones that need to call out to libraries or
more complex APIs), we will integrate these using a set of specialized
VQL plugins over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design differences between Velociraptor and GRR</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/design_differences_between_velociraptor_and_grr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/design_differences_between_velociraptor_and_grr/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="velociraptor-clients-run-full-vql-queries">Velociraptor Clients run full VQL queries&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>GRR's design started off with the assumption that the client should be
minimalist and only support a few simple primitives (such as
ListDirectory, ListProcesses etc). The intention was that most of the
processing would be executed on the server inside a &amp;quot;Flow&amp;quot;. The main
motivation for this design choice was the observation that it is
difficult to upgrade the client in practice, and so with a minimal
client, it would be possible to develop more sophisticated Flows, server
side, without needing to update the clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After running GRR for a while we noticed that this design choice was
problematic, since it leads to many client round trips. For example the
FileFinder flow searches the client's filesystem for files by name,
date etc. GRR's original file finder uses a complex algorithm to issue
ListDirectory requests to the client, receive their responses, filter
and recurse into directories by communicating with the client again.
This leads to many round trips and has a huge performance hit on both
the server and client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor does away with all that by including rich client side
functionality (through VQL plugins), and implementing VQL queries to
perform the filtering. This means that in reality, Velociraptor has very
few client round trips, generally just one: The VQL query is sent to the
client, and the result is received by the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some types of analysis require the results of one operation to feed into
the next operation. For example, suppose we wanted to upload all
executables that are run from a temp directory. This requires listing
all processes, then filtering the ones running from a temp directory,
and finally uploading those to the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GRR's model requires writing a new flow for this - the flow first
issues a ListProcesses request to the client, then receives all
processes where the filtering happens on the server. The server then
issues upload commands for each matching process. Performing this
analysis requires writing and deploying new code making it difficult to
adapt rapidly to changing threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Velociraptor one simply issues the following VQL query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">LET files = SELECT Exe, Cmdline, Username FROM pslist()
 WHERE Exe =~ '(?i)temp'
SELECT Exe, Cmdline, Username, upload(file=Exe) AS Upload
 FROM files
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>VQL avoids this round trip completely, since VQL queries can be nested
and chained together. Therefore one simply runs the first query (list
all processes running from temp directory), and sends the results to the
next query (download the matching files) inside the same VQL client
request. It is rare that Velociraptor flows run multiple client round
trips, resulting in lightweight and fast completing flows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="worker-and-database-queues">Worker and Database queues.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The GRR model of long running flows with multiple client/server
interactions required more complex design. Since client messages can be
delivered in multiple POST requests, and a single request can result in
multiple responses, GRR must queue responses somewhere until they are
all ready to be processed. Otherwise writing GRR flows would be
difficult because one would need to account for incomplete responses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GRR uses a complex request/response protocol to ensure messages are
delivered in order, reminiscent of the TCP stack's packet reassembling
algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the simple request &amp;quot;ListDirectory&amp;quot;. The client request may
elicit thousands of responses (one for each file) and may span multiple
POST operations. The GRR frontend queues all the responses in the
database until it receives a STATUS response, and then fetches once. So even
if the client sends the responses over multiple packets, the flow only
sees a single list. When a status message is seen by the frontend, it
notifies the worker via a worker queue, which collects all responses,
orders them by response ID and delivers to the flow object.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This design is necessary if flows are long lived and need to handle
thousands of responses for each request. However in practice this design
has a couple of serious problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The frontend receives responses and just writes them into the
database in special queue rows, then the worker reads them from the
queue rows for processing (after which they must be deleted from the
database). This leads to a lot of unnecessary read/write/delete
cycles and extra load on the database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The worker queue rows are used by all clients and all flows. This
leads to a lot of database contention on these rows. Extra care must
be taken to ensure no race conditions, through careful management of
database locks. Extra locks slow down the database and typically for
a busy system queue contention is a huge bottleneck.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is easy to observe in practice on a busy GRR system (i.e. one that
is running many flows or hunts) by simply looking at the output from
top. Typically the mysql process uses as much CPU or more than the
frontends and workers combined. This indicates a huge load on the
database and limits scalability. Increasing the number of frontends only
helps marginally because the database throughput becomes the limiting
factor. In fact, increasing the number of workers can deteriorate
performance because workers poll on their queues while holding locks
thereby increasing row lock contention even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor takes a different approach. Since Velociraptor flows are
very simple and typically only consist of a few request/response cycles,
the server does not bother to reorder replies that come in different
packets. Therefore there is no need to temporarily store or queue
responses. Responses can be delivered to the flow as soon as they are
received - and flows typically just write them to the database in their
final storage location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore Velociraptor does not have a dedicated worker, nor does it
have database queues. The frontend itself runs the flows directly on the
received packets while serving the client's poll request. This
completely eliminates the need for worker queues and their associated
database contention issues. Removing the worker queues eliminates a
significant amount of very complex and delicate code. Additionally,
since the responses are not written/read to the queue, the total load on
the database is significantly reduced. (In fact because database lock
contention is so low, Velociraptor can work very well with plain files
through the FileBaseDataStore, even at large scale!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following illustration demonstrates how significant this is for the
simple example of a ListDirectory request of a directory with 1000 files
in it (e.g. the c:windows directory). The equivalent VQL is
select * from glob(paths='c:/windows/*') and only produces a single
response packet containing all the files in the one table, whereas
GRR's ListDirectory client action produces a single response for each
file, which is then queued and stored independently in the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The overall effect, in the GRR case, is that 2000 database rows are
created, of which 1000 rows are immediately deleted - a significant
database load. Compare this with the Velociraptor equivalent flow -the
VQL request is sent to the client once, then the response is returned to
the frontend in a single POST operation. Since Velociraptor does not
have a separate worker and does not need to queue messages to it, the
frontend immediately runs the flow which just writes the result into a
single DB row - total database operations: 1 row written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="image1.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eliminating the need for a separate worker process also simplifies
deployment significantly. GRR needs to deploy separate frontends and
worker processes, and it is often difficult to know which one to scale
up. Scaling up the frontend will allow more packets to be received but
actually increases the load on the database. Not having sufficient
workers will leave many requests on the queue for a long time and will
prolong the execution of the flow since a worker must run the flow in
order to issue the next set of requests. This leads to flows which take
many hours to complete and even hung flows (if the client reboots or
disconnects before the flow finished).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor deployment is much simpler - there is only a single binary
and it can be scaled and load balanced as needed. Since database load is
much lower, the frontend can handle a much larger load. Furthermore, the
flows typically execute in very short time (since there is only one
round trip). The overall result is that flow throughput is much
increased and resource usage is reduced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Files, files everything is just a file!</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/files_files_everything_is_just_a_file/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/files_files_everything_is_just_a_file/</guid><description>&lt;p>GRR's original design abstracted the data storage to a simple key/value
store originally based around Bigtable. For open source deployments
various key value stores were used starting from MongoDB, to SQLite and
finally MySQL. Although the original idea was to use a simple key/value
implementation, due to locking requirements the data store
implementation became very complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Velociraptor introduced a major redesign of the underlying data store
architecture, we are now able to relax our demands of the datastore and
use a true key/value model (since we have no requirements for locking
and synchronization). The default data store is now the
FileBaseDataStore which stores all data in flat files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using flat files over a database has many advantages, including ease of
deployment, and simplification of the data model. Having flat files
allows one to use standard tools to visualize Velociraptor's data
structures (e.g. with less), archive old data (e.g. with tar/zip) and
clean up old data (e.g. with find/rm). Velociraptor also includes an
inspect command which allows users to decode the stored files and
provides context as to what these files actually mean. This simplicity
increases the transparency in the system and makes it more accessible
for deployers, while increasing reliability, stability and speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following section we examine some of the files in the datastore
and see how they relate to the features we discuss elsewhere in this
document.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="file-organization">File organization&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Velociraptor data store needs to provide only two types of
operations: Read and Write complete files and list files in a directory.
Using only these primitives we can implement the entire filestore. Most
modern file systems provide very fast file creation, reading and
deletion, as well as fast directory listing, even when containing
millions of files. Modern file systems also provide advanced features
like caching, journaling and rollbacks so it is not such a crazy idea to
use the file systems themselves as a data store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's begin by listing the files in a typical Velociraptor file store
using the find command. We then use the velociraptor inspect command to
view the file's content.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="searching">Searching&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Searching for clients is implemented by simply creating empty files in
directories based on the search term. For example in order to retrieve
all clients which have the user &amp;quot;mic&amp;quot;, we simply list the directory
&lt;code>client\_index/user%3Amic&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ find ./client_index/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-text"> ./client\_index/c.84216c7aab97557d
 ./client\_index/c.84216c7aab97557d/C.84216c7aab97557d.db./client\_index/user%3Amic
 ./client\_index/user%3Amic/C.84216c7aab97557d.db
 ./client\_index/user%3Amic/C.1b0cddfffbfe40f5.db./client\_index/all
 ./client\_index/all/C.84216c7aab97557d.db
 ./client\_index/all/C.1b0cddfffbfe40f5.db
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Modern file systems can hold many thousands of files in the same

in the GUI's search box but can also be used to script or post process
collected data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="client-information">Client information&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Information about each client is kept in a directory based on the
client's ID:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">./C.0fc63b45671af1a6/ping.db &amp;lt;- Last ping stats.

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Each piece of data is kept in its own file as an encoded protobuf. Files
all have their names end with &amp;quot;.db&amp;quot;. Velociraptor has an inspect
command which decodes the protobuf and displays it in a human friendly
way. For example let us see what information we keep about each s last
poll:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --config server.yaml inspect /tmp/velociraptor/C.2d406f47d80f5583/ping.db
{
 &amp;quot;ipAddress&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;127.0.0.1:33600&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;ping&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1533517053018582&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="the-flows-results">The Flow's results.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Velociraptor's flows typically only produce VQL results. As described
above, the VQL results are typically split into parts by the client (by
default 10000 rows per part), and Velociraptor simply writes these in
the flow's directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">./C.1b0cddfffbfe40f5/flows/F.a31255a1
./C.1b0cddfffbfe40f5/flows/F.a31255a1/results

./C.1b0cddfffbfe40f5/flows/F.a31255a1.db &amp;lt;- Flow information.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Velociraptor's inspect command understands that VQL collections
represent a table of results, and so it displays these in a more
friendly way.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">$ velociraptor --config server.yaml inspect /tmp/velociraptor/C.1b0cddfffbfe40f5/flows/F.a31255a1/results/0.db

&lt;p>We can also see the original VQL query which was run to produce this
output. The bottom line, though, is that the entire flow's result is
just a flat JSON encoded file. You can easily decode the data using any
programming language and post process it in whatever way is appropriate
(e.g. export the results to BigQuery or ElasticSearch). Velociraptor
does not really do anything with the result other than just store it on
disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-virtual-file-system">The Virtual File System&lt;/h2>

implemented in order to avoid database locking and increase hunt
processing efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we hunt like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="31c11844b92d357d823381b120455cb2">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#31c11844b92d357d823381b120455cb2" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="image4.jpg">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-are-hunts-scheduled">How are hunts scheduled?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>GRR allows hunts to be scheduled by a few client properties such as OS
type, label, users etc. This works because GRR has an extensive data
model of endpoint properties. However, this requires that the data model
be refreshed periodically to be kept accurate. For example, to run a
hunt of all machines with a suspected compromised user account we can
schedule the run on all machines where the user has logged in, but
because GRR uses its data model to decide if a machine should be issued
the hunt, the data model may be out of date and GRR will not schedule
the hunt on machines which have only recently been logged into. For this
reason we typically run the Interrogate hunt very frequently causing a
lot of extra load on the system and clients hoping to minimize the time
window where the data model is out of date with reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor's approach is different - since Velociraptor does not
really maintain a data model server side, we check the client's
information for every hunt, before we even decide if the hunt should be
scheduled for this client. This is done by issuing a VQL query to the
client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes we don't necessarily want the client to know exactly why we
are scheduling the hunt (e.g. in the compromised user account case we
don't want to advertise the exact username we are looking for). In
these cases we run another VQL query on the server side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So hunt selection is managed by two different VQL queries - a client
side one and a server side on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The default client side VQL queries simply collects the usual facts like
OS version, Username etc, while the server side query filters the
results with more specific conditions. This approach does not reveal to
the client the hunt's condition:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Client side VQL:
 SELECT OS, Architecture, Fqdn, Platform,
 config.Client_labels AS Labels
 FROM info()

Server side VQL:
 SELECT * from rows
 WHERE Fqdn =~ '(?i)myhostname.+' AND 'MY_LABEL' IN Labels
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="the-hunts-life-cycle">The hunt's life cycle&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When the hunt is started, the server updates its in-memory list of
active hunts managed by the Foreman. Clients then poll the foreman for
new hunts they should participate in. Clients remember the last hunt
they participated in and so they present this hunt's timestamp to the
foreman. If a new hunt is available, the foreman can immediately launch
the &lt;code>CheckHuntCondition&lt;/code> flow on the client.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>The clients themselves are actively keeping track of the hunts they
participated in. This avoids the server having to check the client's DB
record.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>The &lt;code>CheckHuntCondition&lt;/code> flow issues the client side VQL queries and then
runs the server side query on the results. If the query matches (i.e.
the hunt should be scheduled for this client), the client's record is
written into the hunt's &amp;quot;pending&amp;quot; queue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-hunt-manager">The hunt manager&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Each hunt specifies its own client recruitment rate (i.e. how many
clients will be started per minute). The hunt manager is a component
which periodically reads all hunts and schedules flows for these hunts
if the hunts' client rate allows for more clients to be scheduled. It
does this by moving clients from the pending queue to the running queue
and starting respective flows for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once each of those flows completes, the record is moved from the running
queue to the completed queue or the results queue if the flow produced
any results. We can observe how many clients exist in each queue using
the GUI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="1a8f685c15feef92820538fea13ff231">
 &lt;div data-featherlight="#1a8f685c15feef92820538fea13ff231" class="figure">

 &lt;/div>
 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="image2.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flows that hunts launch arn the client. However, when they complete,
a small record is made in the hunts's results queue pointing to the
flow. It is therefore possible to retrieve all results from the hunt
from all client's. For example, the GUI allows downloading a zip file
of all the results and files uploaded:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>











&lt;figure id="316a76dd607f18f9361ef29bc395b2bb">

 &lt;a class="image-link" href="image7.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since hunts invoke regular flows, and Velociraptor flows are much
lighter than GRR's flows, hunts are much cheaper to run in terms of
resources consumed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interrogation - Make the endpoint tell us what it knows!</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/interrogation_make_the_endpoint_tell_us_what_it_knows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/interrogation_make_the_endpoint_tell_us_what_it_knows/</guid><description>&lt;p>When writing Velociraptor we decided to keep things very simple - we did
away with a lot of the information gathered during interrogate in favor
of a much simpler data model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="data-modelling---the-interrogate-flow">Data Modelling - The Interrogate Flow&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>GRR maintains an elaborate model of client data. For example, GRR
collects and maintains a list of clients' network interfaces, users,
user's home directory etc. This information is maintained in elaborate
protobufs and stored in the database in many rows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While some of this information is needed for client searching, GRR
maintains vastly more information than necessary in this data model. The
client data model is built during the interrogate phase (A periodic flow
run on the clients to refresh server side data).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maintaining such a complex data model results in a very rigid design.
For example, if a user wanted to collect more information from clients
they would need to modify protobufs, update the interrogate flow,
recompile the code and redeploy. These modifications are also very
invasive as once code has been heavily modified, there is an overhead of
keeping these modifications in sync with newer upstream versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor also maintains client information via its Interrogate flow.
However, Velociraptor's interrogate flow simply issues a series of VQL
queries, and these responses are stored directly in the database with
minimal interpretation. Indexes are maintained for some information
which users should be able to search on, but there is no attempt to
build or maintain a client data model at all (You can see details of the
model described below in the FileBaseDataStore post).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantage of this approach is that users can simply add extra VQL
queries to the interrogate phase to collect more tailored site specific
information. This does not require compiling of any code or redeploying
the server. The following example illustrates the power of this
technique.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="customizing-the-interrogate-flow">Customizing the Interrogate flow.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Normally Velociraptor collects minimal information from the client upon
interrogation (i.e. when the client first enrols or when interrogated
periodically). However it is very easy to customize this collection
depending on local site requirements. In this section we work through a
step by step example of extending the Velociraptor interrogate flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose that in our deployment we wanted to check if a machine is able
to be logged into remotely. For a Linux machine we want to see all
authorized_keys files on every machine that enrolls. Collecting this
information allows us to quickly see which machines a compromised user
account could spread to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We know we need to issue a VQL query but we are not 100% sure which one.
Luckily we can use Velociraptor itself to run the query locally using
the syntax &amp;quot;velociraptor query &amp;lt;query&amp;gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Start with a simple glob query to find all authorized_keys files:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Suppose we now want to actually grab a copy of all files so we can
archive them on the server This will keep a record of the authorized
keys on the server for each Interrogate flow. If we run the flow
periodically we will end up with a time based evolution of the
authorized keys files on each host. Pretty handy!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT FullPath,
 timestamp(epoch=Sys.Mtim.Sec) as Mtime,
 upload(file=FullPath) as Upload
FROM glob(globs=&amp;quot;/home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We can run the query locally using the Velociraptor tool:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">mic@localhost:/tmp&amp;gt; velociraptor query &amp;quot;select FullPath, \
 timestamp(epoch=Sys.Mtim.Sec) as Mtime, \
 upload(file=FullPath) as Upload \
 FROM glob(globs=['/home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys'])&amp;quot;

velociraptor: Uploaded home/mic/.ssh/authorized_keys (395 bytes)
[
 {
 &amp;quot;FullPath&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/home/mic/.ssh/authorized_keys&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;Mtime&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2018-08-03T18:20:19+10:00&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;Upload&amp;quot;: {
 &amp;quot;Path&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;home/mic/.ssh/authorized_keys&amp;quot;,
 &amp;quot;Size&amp;quot;: 395
 }
}
]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Velociraptor's query command enables us to run the query directly on
the local host and observe the results. When the same query is issued to
the Velociraptor client, the same result will be generated and sent to
the server. This enables us to interactively develop and test our
queries without needing to run a full client/server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note the upload() VQL function which causes the file to be uploaded to
the server. (When run locally the file will be copied to the upload
directory as can be seen by the upload confirmation message), but when
run within the Velociraptor client, the file will be uploaded to the
server and stored within the flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can now add the query to all Interrogate flows that will be run from
now on. We simply add it to the configuration file under the
Interrogate.additional_queries key:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">Interrogate.additional_queries:
 Query:
 - Name: Authorized Keys
 VQL: &amp;gt;
 select FullPath, timestamp(epoch=Mtime.Sec) as Mtime,
 upload(file=FullPath) as Upload
 from glob(globs='/home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys')
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From now on the additional query will be recorded for all clients. The
GUI shows it in the client information page:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="mynotices warning">
 &lt;div heading="warning">&lt;p>This page is written about a very old version of VQL and is retained
for historical purposes. Current VQL works differently - consult the
current documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;h1 id="vql-overview">VQL Overview&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>VQL is only loosely based around SQL in the sense that the general
statement structure is similar. However, VQL is a very simple dialect.
Like SQL, a VQL query produces a table of results with specific columns
and multiple rows. Unlike SQL, the data inside each cell is not limited
to simple primitive types (like string, integer etc). In fact any JSON
serializable object can be generated in a table's cell. It is not
uncommon to generate an entire JSON object with additional fields in
each row for a single column.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic structure of a VQL statement is:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT Column1, Column2, Column3
FROM plugin(arg=value) WHERE Column1 &amp;gt; 5
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>There are three main parts: Column selectors, Plugin and Filter
Conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plugins">Plugins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The VQL plugin is VQL's data source. Plugins are specific pieces of
code which may accept arguments and generate a sequence of rows. VQL's
strength is that these plugins are very easy to write and can be added
to Velociraptor in order to add extra functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike SQL, VQL plugins take keyword arguments. This allows Velociraptor
plugins to be easily customizable and adaptable. For example, a plugin
may list all chrome extensions, and receive an argument pointing it to
the user's home directory so it can flexibly be applied to different
situations. The ability to provide arguments to plugins encourages
writing more generic plugins which can be reused in multiple situations.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>VQL plugins currently only accept keyword arguments. It is a syntax
error to pass args without naming them - &lt;code>glob(&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)&lt;/code> is not valid
syntax, it should be &lt;code>glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;p>It is important to appreciate that Plugins generate data dynamically.
The data is not stored in a database table first! Plugins may begin
generating data immediately and the VQL query will begin processing this
data, even if the total amount of data is very large. The Plugin's data
is not stored in memory all at once! This allows for plugins to produce
an unbounded number of rows and the query will proceed until the
required number of results is achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plugins may also be cancelled when the query completes, even if the
plugin itself is not exhausted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="column-selectors">Column selectors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Column selectors are a group of expressions specifying which columns
will be produced in the output table. As mentioned previously, the
values produced in each column are not limited to simple types -it is
common to produce entire JSON objects (and even additional tables),
lists of values etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The column selectors specify a transformation to be performed on the
output of the plugin in producing the query's columns. The simplest
transformation is a single &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;, which means no transformation at all
(i.e. relay to the output table exactly the output of the plugin).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since plugins may produce any object (for example, a JSON object with
nested fields), VQL column specifications can dereference nested fields
within the produced data.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT Sys.Mtim.Sec FROM glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Specifying only selected columns can limit the number of columns
produced and make the output more useful by removing unneeded fields.
For example the following will produce a result table with two columns
named FullPath and SIze and a row per file found in the /bin/ directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT FullPath, Size from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Column specifications can consist of arbitrary expressions - for example
addition, comparisons:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT FullPath + '.bindir', Size from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;) WHERE Size &amp;lt; 1000
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In this case it is often useful to add a Column Alias (Note that column
aliases can also be used in the WHERE clause):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT FullPath + '.bindir' as Sanitized, Size from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>VQL Functions provide a way to extend VQL expressions. Unlike full
plugins they do not produce a sequence of rows, but simply produce a
single value (which can be an arbitrary o function formats a timestamp
as a string. This is useful since many plugins produce times in seconds
since epoch time:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT FullPath, timestamp(epoch=Sys.Mtim.Sec) as mtimefrom glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;div class="mynotices note">
 &lt;div heading="note">&lt;p>Some VQL functions have side effects, or are more expensive to run. It
is important to understand that VQL transforms the columns emitted from
a plugin BEFORE it applies filtering conditions. This is needed in order
to allow for column transformations to participate in the filter
condition (via the alias).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to this order of operations the following query will upload all
files, ignoring the WHERE condition because the upload() function will
be evaluated on each row, even if the WHERE clause causes the row to be
ignored:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">SELECT FullPath, upload(path=FullPath)
 from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
 WHERE Name =~ &amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To upload only the files matching the expression, the query must be
split into two - the first query applies the filtering condition and the
second query does the upload:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-vql">LET files = SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
 WHERE Name =~ &amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;
SELECT FullPath, upload(path=FullPath) from files
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>


&lt;h2 id="vql-subselects">VQL Subselects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unlike SQL, VQL does not have a join operator. SQL is designed to work
with databases, and databases have multiple strategies for optimizing
query execution (like adding table indexes, query planners etc).
Traditionally, SQL authors prefers joins over subselects because in a
real database JOIN operations are more optimized to use the database's
indexes and query optimizer. However JOIN operations are arguably harder
to read and it is hard to predict the order at where operations will be
run (e.g. which table will use an index and which will use a row scan).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since VQL has no indexes nor does it have a query optimizer,
implementing JOIN operations does not make sense. Instead, VQL
implements subselects and multi-statement queries and using these tools
it is possible for VQL authors to precisely control the query execution
plan so it is most efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this sense VQL authors are left to specify the most efficient course
of query execution themselves instead of relying on a query optimizer.
This is normally done by dividing the query into smaller queries and
combining their results in the best order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the following query that attempts to search small files for the
keyword &amp;quot;foobar&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;) where
 grep(path=FullPath, keywords=[&amp;quot;foobar&amp;quot;]) and Size &amp;lt; 1000
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Velociraptor will execute the following steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Run the glob() plugin to produce all the files in the /bin/
directory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transform each row to produce the FullPath.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluate the Filter condition on each row. The filter condition
requires running the grep() plugin on each file looking for the
keyword and evaluating if the SIze of the file is less than 1000.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If both conditions are TRUE then Velociraptor will emit the row into
the result table.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It is obvious that this is an inefficient query because each and every
file will be searched for the keyword regardless of its size. However,
there is no point even trying if the file size is not less than 1000
bytes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem here is that there are two conditions which both must be
true - but each condition has a different cost associated with it.
Clearly the grep() condition is more expensive since it requires opening
the file and reading it completely. The Size condition is extremely
cheap since it is just an integer comparison.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, VQL is not aware of the relative cost of the two conditions -it
does not know that grep() is inherently an expensive operation since to
VQL it just looks like another function. Although VQL does some
short cutting (for example it will cancel the grep() function if Size &amp;gt;=
1000) this shortcut cancellation may arrive too late to stop grep() from
doing a significant amount of work. The VQL author must be aware of the
relative costs of the different operations and how the query should be
structured for maximum efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we would really like is for VQL to evaluate the cheap condition,
and only for those files smaller than 1000 bytes, evaluate the grep()
condition. This allows us to eliminate most files immediately (since
most files are larger than 1000 bytes) such that we only bother to
grep() very few files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be achieved by splitting the query into two and chaining them
together:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">LET file = select * from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;) WHERE Size &amp;lt; 1000

SELECT FullPath from file WHERE grep(
 path=FullPath, keywords=[&amp;quot;foobar&amp;quot;])
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The LET keyword allows us to define a &amp;quot;stored query&amp;quot;. A Stored Query
is a query which is assigned into a variable name - you can think of the
statement as running the entire query and storing the output into a
single variable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second query then takes the result of this query and applies further
transformations and filtering on it. By ensuring that the cheap
conditions are evaluated in the stored query, we can ensure that the
number of rows stored in the LET expression is smaller than the total
number of rows produced by the glob() plugin, and therefore the grep()
function will be applied on few rows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can think of stored queries as running in multiple steps: First the
LET query is executed, then all its rows are stored in the files
variable, while the second query reads each row and applies its own
filtering on it. In reality though, the LET query is lazy in its
evaluation and will only produce results when required. Velociraptor
does not store the entire result table of the LET query in memory at
once! It is quite safe therefore to run a very large query in the LET
clause without fear of memory overrun.
:::&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="escaping-parameters">Escaping parameters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>VQL queries often need to take user input. For example consider the
query:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We might want to allow the user to specify the glob expression and
create the query programmatically. While it is possible to ensure user
input is escaped this is inefficient and tedious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VQL queries have an &amp;quot;Environment&amp;quot;. The Environment is essentially the
evaluation scope of the query - in other words it contains all the
values which can be accessed by name. For example when we call a VQL
function like timestamp(), it is placed in the evaluation scope. It is
possible to place anything in the environment (or the evaluation scope)
and in particular, user parameters can also be placed there. In this
case there is no need to escape user input as it is treated as a part of
the environment and not the query. For example placing PATH=&amp;quot;/bin/*&amp;quot;
into the environment, will allow the following query to run
successfully:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{.sourceCode">SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=PATH)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should always try to write VQL queries referring to parameters in
the environment because this makes them reusable - the scope parameters
become inputs to your query and the query becomes a reusable function.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing Velociraptor</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/introducing_velociraptor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2018 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/html/2018/08/10/introducing_velociraptor/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hunting-and-responding-like-a-raptor">Hunting and responding like a raptor!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>At Velocidex we have been running open source endpoint monitoring tools
for our clients in order to detect and respond to incidents. One of our
favorite tools is GRR, developed by Google internally and then released
as open source. GRR is a very powerful tool, with a polished UI and good
documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately the open source version released by Google suffers from
some shortcomings and so we have decided to develop a new project, built
on the shoulders of giants called Velociraptor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are Velociraptor's design goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Focus on data collection.&lt;/strong> Velociraptor's primary use case is to
collect data and export it to other systems. Velociraptor does no
analysis itself and therefore has no need for a complex data
model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Flexibility&lt;/strong>. Velociraptor can adapt easily to new requirements
without needing to redeploy either clients or servers. Using VQL
(Velocidex Query Language) provides flexibility in the type and
number of queries that are used to rapidly adapt to changing
requirements. VQL allows us to collect just the information needed
and no more in an adaptive way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Remove abstractions&lt;/strong>. Velociraptor aims to be as simple to
understand as possible. The default data store simply stores files
in the file system which may be easily inspected by the user. No
special tooling is required to script or manage Velociraptor.
Reduce demand on the data store. Rather than increase the data
store requirements, we want to simplify the design to the point
that requirements on the data store are so low, one can run a
medium to large sized deployment with very few resources (down to
perhaps a single server machine). In fact the default data store
does not even use a database, but simply uses flat files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simplify everything!&lt;/strong> Velociraptor aims to be very simple to run
and administer. We remove a lot of the GRR functionality that we
don&amp;rsquo;t find we use often. Velociraptor ships as a single, statically
linked executable which can perform all actions necessary for
deployers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In short we really wanted something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

 &lt;figcaption>
 &lt;a class="image-link" href="image5.png">&lt;i class="fa fa-download">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
 
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>




&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Velociraptor is a new end point monitoring and IR
tool built upon GRR's groundwork and experience. To be clear, we reused
some of GRR's code and some design elements, but Velociraptor is a new
project and is largely a rewrite of GRR's codebase. Like GRR,
Velociraptor is released under an open source license and is a community
project hosted on &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/velocidex/velociraptor" target="_blank" >https://gitlab.com/velocidex/velociraptor&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is still very early days and we would love to receive feedback and
suggestions. This is the first technology preview release and we hope to
make a more stable and comprehensive release in the coming months. As
Velociraptor becomes more battle tested we hope the codebase will
stabilize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The near term roadmap is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improve support for more operating systems. Especially Windows:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Registry based VQL plugins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NTFS support for raw disk access.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Memory scanning and rudimentary Memory analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design a more efficient client/server communication mechanism - long
polling is problematic since clients only poll infrequently (e.g.
every 10 minutes). We want to be able to control all clients
quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a library of VQL expressions which may be reusable. This
should be similar to GRR's idea of Artifacts but be more geared
towards VQL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
