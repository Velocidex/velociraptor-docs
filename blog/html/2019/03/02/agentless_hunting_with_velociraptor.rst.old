There has been a lot of interest lately in Agentless hunting
especially using PowerShell. There are many reasons why Agentless
hunting is appealing - there are already a ton of endpoint agents and
yet another one may not be welcome. Somtimes we need to deploy
endpoint agents as part of a DFIR engagement and we may not want to
permanently install yet another agent on end points.

This blog post explores an agentless deployment scenario, where we do
not want to install Velociraptor permanently on the end point, but
rather push it to end points temporarily to collect specific
artifacts. The advantage of this method is that there are no permanent
changes to the end point, as nothing is actually installed. However,
we do get the full power of Velociraptor to collect artifacts, hunt
for evil and more...

Agentless Velociraptor
----------------------

Normally when deploying Velociraptor as a service, the binary is
copied to the system and a service is installed. The service ensures
that the binary is restarted when the system reboots, and so
Velociraptor is installed on a permanent basis.

However in the agentless deployment scenario we simply run the binary
from a network share using group policy settings. The downside to this
approach is that the endpoint needs to be on the domain network to
receive the group policy update (and have the network share
accessible) before it can run Velociraptor. When we run in Agentless
mode we are really after collecting a bunch of artifacts via hunts and
then exiting - the agent will not restart after a reboot. So this
method is suitable for quick hunts on corporate (non roaming) assets.

In this post I will use Windows 2019 Server but this should also work
on any older version.

Creating a network share
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to create a network share with the Velociraptor
binary and its configuration file. We will run the binary from the
share in this example, but for more reliability you may want to copy
the binary into e.g. a temp folder on the end point in case the system
becomes disconnected from the domain. For quick hunts though it should
be fine.

We create a directory on the server (I will create it on the domain
controller but you should probably not do that - find another machine
to host the share).

I created a directory `C:\\Users\\Deployment` and ensured that it is
read only. I have shared the directory as the name Deployment.

I now place the Velociraptor executable and client config file in that
directory and verify that I can run the binary from the network
share. The binary should be accessible via
`\\\\\\\\DC\\Deployment\\velociraptor.exe`:

Creating the group policy object.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we create the group policy object which forces all domain
connected machines to run the Velociraptor client. We use the Group
Policy Management Console:

.. image:: 3.png

Select the OU or the entire domain and click "Create New GPO":

.. image:: 4.png

Now right click the GPO object and select "Edit":

.. image:: 5.png

We will create a new scheduled task. Rather than schedule it at a
particular time, we will select to run it immediately. This will force
the command to run as soon as the endpoint updates its group policy
settings (i.e. we do not want to wait for the next reboot of the
endpoint).

.. image:: 6.png

Next we give the task a name and a description. In order to allow
Velociraptor to access raw devices (e.g. to collect memory or NTFS
artifacts) we can specify that the client will run at
`NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges, and run without any user being
logged on. It is also worth ticking the "hidden" checkbox here to
prevent a console box from appearing.

.. image:: 7.png

Next click the Actions tab and add a new action. This is where we
launch the Velociraptor client. The program will simply be launched
from the share (i.e. `\\\\\\\\DC\\Deployment\\velociraptor.exe`) and we give
it the arguments allowing it to read the provided configuration file
(i.e. `--config \\\\\\\\DC\\Deployment\\client.config.yaml client -v`).

.. image:: 8.png

In the setting tab we can control how long we want the client to
run. For a quick hunt this may be an hour or two but maybe for a DFIR
engagement it might be a few days. The GPO will ensure the client is
killed after the allotted time.

.. image:: 9.png

Once the GPO is installed it becomes active for all domain
machines. You can now schedule any hunts you wish using the
Velociraptor GUI. When a domain machine refreshes its group policy it
will run the client, which will enroll and immediately participate in
any outstanding hunts - thus collecting and delivering its artifacts
to the server. After the allotted time has passed, the client will
shut down without having installed anything on the endpoint.

You can force a group policy update by running the `gpupdate`
program. Now you can verify that Velociraptor is running:

Persistence
~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that when running Velociraptor in agent less mode you probably
want to configure it so that the writeback file is written to the temp
directory. The writeback file is how the client keeps track of its key
material (and identity). The default is to store it in the client's
installation folder, but you should probably change it in the client's
config file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   Client:
     writeback_windows: $TEMP\\velociraptor.writeback.yaml


The file will remain in the client's temp directory so if you ever
decide to run the agentless client again (by pushing another group
policy) the client id remains the same.
