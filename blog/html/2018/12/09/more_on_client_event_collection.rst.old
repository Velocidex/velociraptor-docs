  Previously we have seen that Velociraptor can monitor client events
  using Event Artifacts. To recap, Event Artifacts are simply artifacts
  which contain event VQL queries. Velociraptor's VQL queries do not
  have to terminate by themselves - instead VQL queries may run
  indefinitely, trickling results over time.

  This post takes another look at event queries and demonstrates how
  these can be used to implement some interesting features.

Periodic Event queries
----------------------

The simplest kind of events are periodically generated events. These
are created using the `clock()` VQL plugin. This is a simple event
plugin which just emits a new row periodically.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ velociraptor query "select Unix from clock(period=5)" --max_wait 1
   [
    {
      "Unix": 1544339715
    }
   ][
    {
      "Unix": 1544339720
    }
   ]^C

The query will never terminate, instead the `clock()` plugin will emit
a new timestamp every 5 seconds. Note the `--max_wait` flag which
tells Velociraptor to wait at least for 1 second in order to batch
rows before reporting them.


This query is not very interesting! Let's do something more
interesting. GRR has a feature where each client sends its own CPU use
and memory footprint sampled every minutes to the server. This is a
really useful feature because it can be used to make sure the client's
impact on the host's performance is minimal.

Let us implement the same feature with a VQL query. What we want is to
measure the client's footprint every minute and send that to the
server:

.. code-block:: psql

        SELECT * from foreach(
         row={
           SELECT UnixNano FROM clock(period=60)
         },
         query={
           SELECT UnixNano / 1000000000 as Timestamp,
                  Times.user + Times.system as CPU,
                  MemoryInfo.RSS as RSS
           FROM pslist(pid=getpid())
         })


This query runs the `clock()` VQL plugin and for each row it emits, we
run the `pslist()` plugin, extracting the total CPU time (system +
user) used by our own pid (i.e. the Velociraptor client).

We can now encapsulate this query in an `artifact </blog/html/reference/artifacts.html#generic-client-stats>`_ and collect it:

.. code-block:: bash

      $ velociraptor artifacts collect Generic.Client.Stats --max_wait 1 --format json
      [][
        {
        "CPU": 0.06999999999999999,
        "RSS": 18866176,
        "Timestamp": 1544340582.9939497
        }
      ][
        {
        "CPU": 0.09,
        "RSS": 18866176,
        "Timestamp": 1544340602.9944408
        }
      ]^C


.. note::

   You must specify the --format json to be able to see the results
   from event queries on the command line. Otherwise Velociraptor will
   try to get all the results so it can format them in a table and
   never return any results.


Installing the event collector.
-------------------------------

In order to have clients collect this event, we need to add the
artifact to the server. Simply add the YAML file into a directory on
the server and start the server with the --definitions flag. Then
simply add the event name to the Events clause of the server
configuration. When clients connect to the server they will
automatically start collecting these events and sending them to the
server:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ velociraptor --definitions path/to/my/artifacts/ frontend

.. code-block:: yaml

   Events:
     artifacts:
     - Generic.Client.Stats
     version: 2

Note that we do not need to redeploy any clients, modify any code or
recompile anything. We simply add the new artifact definition and
clients will automatically start monitoring and feeding back our
information.

The data is sent to the server where it is stored in a file (Events are stored in a unique file for each day).

For example, the path
`/var/lib/velociraptor/clients/C.772d16449719317f/monitoring/Artifact%20Generic.Client.Stats/2018-12-10`
stores all events collected from client id `C.772d16449719317f` for
the `Generic.Client.Stats` artifact on the day of `2018-12-10`.

In the next blog post we will demonstrate how these events can be post
processed and acted on. It is important to note that the Velociraptor
server does not interpret the collected monitoring events at all -
they are simply appended to the daily log file (which is a CSV file).

The CSV file can then be imported into basically any tool designed to
work with tabular data (e.g. spreadsheets, databases, BigQuery
etc). CSV is almost universally supported by all major systems.
