Previously we have seen how Velociraptor collects information from end
points using Velociraptor artifacts. These artifacts encapsulate user
created queries using the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL). The power
of VQL is that it provides for a very flexible way of specifying
exactly what should be collected from the client and how - without
needing to modify client code or deploy new clients!

This is not the whole story though! It is also possible to run VQL
queries on the server side! Similarly server side Velociraptor
artifacts can be used to customize the operation of the server -
without modifying any code or redeploying the server components.

Server Side VQL Queries.
------------------------

By now you are probably familiar with Velociraptor and VQL. We have
seen that it is possible to run a VQL query interactively from the
commandline. For example to find all processes matching the 'gimp':

.. code-block:: bash

   $ velociraptor query \
      "SELECT Pid, Exe, Cmdline FROM pslist() WHERE Exe =~ 'gimp'"
   [
    {
     "Cmdline": "gimp-2.10",
     "Exe": "/usr/bin/gimp-2.10",
     "Pid": 13207
    }
   ]


We have used this feature previously in order to perfect and test our
queries by interactively building the query as we go along.

However it is also possible to run queries on the server itself in
order to collect information about the server. There is nothing
special about this as such - it is simply that some VQL plugins are
able to operate on the server's internal data store and therefore
provide a way to interact with the server via VQL queries.

.. note::

   Other endpoint monitoring tools export a rich API and even an API
   client library to enable users to customize and control their
   installation. For example, GRR expects users write python scripts
   using the GRR client API library.

   Velociraptor's approach is different - the functionality typically
   available via APIs is made available to VQL queries via VQL plugins
   (e.g. client information, flow information and results
   collected). In this way the VQL itself forms an API with which one
   controls the server and deployment. There is no need to write any
   code - simply use existing VQL plugins in any combination that
   makes sense to create new functionality - then encapsulates these
   queries inside Velociraptor artifacts for reuse and sharing.


For example, to see all the clients and their hostnames:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ velociraptor query \
     "SELECT os_info.fqdn as Hostname, client_id from clients()" --format text
  +-----------------+--------------------+
  |    Hostname     |     client_id      |
  +-----------------+--------------------+
  | mic-Inspiron    | C.772d16449719317f |
  | TestComputer    | C.11a3013cca8f826e |
  | trek            | C.952156a4b022ddee |
  | DESKTOP-IOME2K5 | C.c916a7e445eb0868 |
  +-----------------+--------------------+
  SELECT os_info.fqdn AS Hostname,
  client_id FROM clients()

To inspect what flows were run on a client:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ velociraptor query \
       "SELECT runner_args.creator, runner_args.flow_name, \
        runner_args.start_time FROM \
        flows(client_id='C.772d16449719317f')"
    [
    {
      "runner_args.creator": "",
      "runner_args.flow_name": "MonitoringFlow",
      "runner_args.start_time": 1544338661236625
    },
    {
      "runner_args.creator": "mic",
      "runner_args.flow_name": "VFSDownloadFile",
      "runner_args.start_time": 1544087705756469
    },
    ...


Client Event Monitoring
-----------------------

We have also previously seen that Velociraptor can collect event
streams from clients. For example, the client's process execution logs
can be streamed to the server. Clients can also receive event queries
which forward selected events from the windows event logs.

When we covered those features in earlier blog posts, we stressed that
the Velociraptor server does not actually do anything with the client
events, other than save them to a file. The server just writes the
client's events in simple Comma Separated files (CSV files) on the
server.

We mentioned that it is possible to import this file into another tool
(e.g. a spreadsheet or database) for post-processing. An alternative
is to perform post-processing with Velociraptor itself using server
side VQL queries.

For example, we can filter a client's process execution log using a
VQL query:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ velociraptor query "SELECT * from monitoring(
         client_id='C.87b19dba006fcddb',
         artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation')
       WHERE Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc' "
   [
    {
     "CommandLine": "\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\PSEXESVC.exe\"",
     "Name": "\"PSEXESVC.exe\"",
     "PID": "452",
     "PPID": "512",
     "Timestamp": "\"2018-12-09T23:30:42-08:00\"",
     "artifact": "Windows.Events.ProcessCreation",
     "client_id": "C.87b19dba006fcddb"
    }
   ]

The above query finds running instances of psexec's service
component - a popular method of lateral movement and privilege
escalation.

This query uses the `monitoring()` VQL plugin which opens each of the
CSV event monitoring logs for the specified artifact on the server,
decodes the CSV file and emits all the rows within it into the VQL
Query. The rows are then filtered by applying the regular expression
to the name.


Server side event queries
-------------------------

VQL queries do not have to terminate at all. Some VQL plugins can run
indefinitely, emitting rows at random times - usually in response to
some events. These are called Event Queries since they never
terminate. We saw this property when monitoring the client - the above
`Windows.Events.ProcessCreation` artifact uses an event query which
emits a single row for each process execution on the end point.

However, we can also have Event Queries on the server. When used in
this way the query triggers in response to data collected by the
server of various clients.

For example, consider the above query to detect instances of `psexec`
executions. While we can detect this by filtering existing monitoring
event logs, it would be nice to be able to respond to such an event
dynamically.

One way is to repeatedly run the same query (say every minute) and
look for newly reported instances of `psexec` executions. But this
approach is not terribly efficient. A better approach is to install
a watcher on the monitoring event log:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ velociraptor query "SELECT * from watch_monitoring(
        client_id='C.87b19dba006fcddb',
        artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation') where Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc' "
   [
    {
     "CommandLine": "\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\PSEXESVC.exe\"",
     "Name": "\"PSEXESVC.exe\"",
     "PID": "4592",
     "PPID": "512",
     "Timestamp": "\"2018-12-10T01:18:06-08:00\"",
     "artifact": "Windows.Events.ProcessCreation",
     "client_id": "C.87b19dba006fcddb"
    }
   ]

The watcher efficiently follows the monitoring CSV file to detect new
events. These events are then emitted into the VQL query and
subsequently filtered. When the query processes all rows in the file,
the plugin just sleeps and waits for the file to grow again. The
`watch_monitoring()` plugin essentially tails the CSV file as it is
being written. Note that due to the fact that log files are never
truncated and always grow, and that CSV file format is a simple, one
row per line format it is possible to both read and write to the same
file without locking. This makes following a growing log file
extremely efficient and safe - even from another process.

Responding to server side events
--------------------------------

The previous query will return a row when psexec is run on the
client. This is a very suspicious event in our environment and we
would like to escalate this by sending us an email.

We can modify the above query to send an email for each event:

.. code-block:: psql

   SELECT * FROM foreach(
      row={
        SELECT * from watch_monitoring(
          client_id='C.87b19dba006fcddb',
          artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation')
       WHERE Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc'
      },
      query={
        SELECT * FROM mail(
          to='admin@example.com',
          subject='PsExec launched on host',
          period=60,
          body=format(format='PsExec execution detected at %v: %v',
                      args=[Timestamp, Commandline])
        )
      })

The query sends an email from each event emitted. The message body is
formatted using the `format()` VQL function and this includes
important information from the generated event. Note that the `mail()`
plugin restricts the frequency of mails to prevent triggering the mail
server's spam filters. So if two psexec executions occur within 60
seconds we will only get one email.

In order for Velociraptor to be able to send mail you must configure
SMTP parameters in the server's configuration file. The following
example uses gmail to send mails (other mail providers will have
similar authentication requirements).

.. code-block:: yaml

   Mail:
     server: "smtp.gmail.com"
     auth_username: someuser@gmail.com
     auth_password: zldifhjsdflkjfsdlie

The password in the configuration is an application specific password
obtained from
https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords

Tying it all together: Server Side Event Artifacts
--------------------------------------------------

As always we really want to encapsulate VQL queries in artifact
definitions. This way we can design specific alerts, document them and
invoke them by name. Let us encapsulate the above queries in a new
artifact:

.. code-block:: yaml

      name: Server.Alerts.PsExec
      description:  |
         Send an email if execution of the psexec service was detected on any client.

         Note this requires that the Windows.Event.ProcessCreation
         monitoring artifact be collected.

      parameters:
        - name: EmailAddress
          default: admin@example.com
        - name: MessageTemplate
          default: |
            PsExec execution detected at %v: %v for client %v

      sources:
        - queries:
           - |
             SELECT * FROM foreach(
               row={
                 SELECT * from watch_monitoring(
                   artifact='Windows.Events.ProcessCreation')
                 WHERE Name =~ '(?i)psexesvc'
               },
               query={
                 SELECT * FROM mail(
                   to=EmailAddress,
                   subject='PsExec launched on host',
                   period=60,
                   body=format(
                     format=MessageTemplate,
                     args=[Timestamp, CommandLine, ClientId])
                )
             })


We create a new directory called `my_artifact_directory` and store
that file inside as `psexesvc.yaml`. Now, on the server we invoke the
artifact collector and instruct it to also add our private artifacts:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ velociraptor --definitions my_artifact_directory/ \
       --config ~/server.config.yaml \
       --format json \
       artifacts collect Server.Alerts.PsExec
   INFO:2018/12/10 21:36:27 Loaded 40 built in artifacts
   INFO:2018/12/10 21:36:27 Loading artifacts my_artifact_directory/
   [][
    {
     "To": [
       "admin@example.com"
     ],
     "CC": null,
     "Subject": "PsExec launched on host",
     "Body": "PsExec execution detected at \"2018-12-10T03:36:49-08:00\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\PSEXESVC.exe\"",
     "Period": 60
    }
   ]



Conclusions
-----------

This blog post demonstrates how VQL can be used on the server to
create a full featured incident response framework. Velociraptor does
not dictate a particular workflow, since all its actions are governed
by VQL queries and artifacts. Using the same basic building blocks,
users can fashion their own highly customized incident response
workflow. Here is a brainstorm of possible actions:

1. An artifact can be written to automatically collect a memory
   capture if a certain event is detected.

2. Using the `http_client()` VQL plugin, when certain events are
   detected on the server open a ticket automatically (using a SOAP or
   JSON API).

3. If a particular event is detected, immediately shut the machine
   down or quarantine it (by running shell commands on the compromised
   host).

The possibilities are truly endless. Comment below if you have more
interesting ideas and do not hesitate to contribute artifact
definitions to address your real world use cases.
