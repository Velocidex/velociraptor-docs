  A hunt is a feature where a single flow may be run on multiple clients
  at the same time. Typically a hunt looks for a particular indicator of
  compromise across the entire deployment, or maybe collect the same
  files from every deployed agent. By their nature, hunts cause multiple
  flows to run simultaneously and so this creates a large contention of
  shared state.

Velociraptor has completely redesigned the way that hunts are
implemented in order to avoid database locking and increase hunt
processing efficiency.

Now we hunt like this:

How are hunts scheduled?
------------------------

GRR allows hunts to be scheduled by a few client properties such as OS
type, label, users etc. This works because GRR has an extensive data
model of endpoint properties. However, this requires that the data
model be refreshed periodically to be kept accurate. For example, to
run a hunt of all machines with a suspected compromised user account
we can schedule the run on all machines where the user has logged in,
but because GRR uses its data model to decide if a machine should be
issued the hunt, the data model may be out of date and GRR will not
schedule the hunt on machines which have only recently been logged
into. For this reason we typically run the Interrogate hunt very
frequently causing a lot of extra load on the system and clients
hoping to minimize the time window where the data model is out of date
with reality.

Velociraptor's approach is different - since Velociraptor does not
really maintain a data model server side, we check the client's
information for every hunt, before we even decide if the hunt should
be scheduled for this client. This is done by issuing a VQL query to
the client.

Sometimes we don't necessarily want the client to know exactly why we
are scheduling the hunt (e.g. in the compromised user account case we
don't want to advertise the exact username we are looking for). In
these cases we run another VQL query on the server side.


So hunt selection is managed by two different VQL queries - a client
side one and a server side on.

The default client side VQL queries simply collects the usual facts
like OS version, Username etc, while the server side query filters the
results with more specific conditions. This approach does not reveal
to the client the hunt's condition:

.. code-block:: sql

  Client side VQL:
      SELECT OS, Architecture, Fqdn, Platform,
        config.Client_labels AS Labels
        FROM info()

  Server side VQL:
      SELECT * from rows
        WHERE Fqdn =~ '(?i)myhostname.+' AND 'MY_LABEL' IN Labels


The hunt's life cycle
---------------------

When the hunt is started, the server updates its in-memory list of
active hunts managed by the Foreman. Clients then poll the foreman for
new hunts they should participate in. Clients remember the last hunt
they participated in and so they present this hunt's timestamp to the
foreman. If a new hunt is available, the foreman can immediately
launch the CheckHuntCondition flow on the client.

.. note::

   The clients themselves are actively keeping track of the hunts they
   participated in. This avoids the server having to check the
   client's DB record.

The CheckHuntCondition flow issues the client side VQL queries and
then runs the server side query on the results. If the query matches
(i.e. the hunt should be scheduled for this client), the client's
record is written into the hunt's "pending" queue.

The hunt manager
----------------

Each hunt specifies its own client recruitment rate (i.e. how many
clients will be started per minute). The hunt manager is a component
which periodically reads all hunts and schedules flows for these hunts
if the hunts' client rate allows for more clients to be scheduled. It
does this by moving clients from the pending queue to the running
queue and starting respective flows for them.

Once each of those flows completes, the record is moved from the
running queue to the completed queue or the results queue if the flow
produced any results. We can observe how many clients exist in each
queue using the GUI.

The flows that hunts launch arn the client. However, when they
complete, a small record is made in the hunts's results queue pointing
to the flow. It is therefore possible to retrieve all results from the
hunt from all client's. For example, the GUI allows downloading a zip
file of all the results and files uploaded:

Since hunts invoke regular flows, and Velociraptor flows are much
lighter than GRR's flows, hunts are much cheaper to run in terms of
resources consumed.
