  Velociraptor is powered by VQL and VQL is the killer feature which
  makes it so powerful. But what exactly is VQL? This section is a quick

VQL Overview
------------

VQL is only loosely based around SQL in the sense that the general
statement structure is similar. However, VQL is a very simple
dialect. Like SQL, a VQL query produces a table of results with
specific columns and multiple rows. Unlike SQL, the data inside each
cell is not limited to simple primitive types (like string, integer
etc). In fact any JSON serializable object can be generated in a
table's cell. It is not uncommon to generate an entire JSON
object with additional fields in each row for a single column.

The basic structure of a VQL statement is:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT Column1, Column2, Column3 from plugin(arg=value) WHERE Column1 > 5


There are three main parts: Column selectors, Plugin and Filter Conditions.

Plugins
~~~~~~~

The VQL plugin is VQL's data source. Plugins are specific pieces of
code which may accept arguments and generate a sequence of rows. VQL's
strength is that these plugins are very easy to write and can be added
to Velociraptor in order to add extra functionality.

Unlike SQL, VQL plugins take keyword arguments. This allows
Velociraptor plugins to be easily customizable and adaptable. For
example, a plugin may list all chrome extensions, and receive an
argument pointing it to the user's home directory so it can flexibly
be applied to different situations. The ability to provide arguments
to plugins encourages writing more generic plugins which can be reused
in multiple situations.

.. note::

   VQL plugins currently only accept keyword arguments. It is a syntax
   error to pass args without naming them - `glob("/bin/*")` is not
   valid syntax, it should be `glob(globs="/bin/*")`

It is important to appreciate that Plugins generate data
dynamically. The data is not stored in a database table first! Plugins
may begin generating data immediately and the VQL query will begin
processing this data, even if the total amount of data is very
large. The Plugin's data is not stored in memory all at once!  This
allows for plugins to produce an unbounded number of rows and the
query will proceed until the required number of results is achieved.

Plugins may also be cancelled when the query completes, even if the
plugin itself is not exhausted.

Column selectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Column selectors are a group of expressions specifying which
columns will be produced in the output table. As mentioned previously,
the values produced in each column are not limited to simple types -
it is common to produce entire JSON objects (and even additional
tables), lists of values etc.

The column selectors specify a transformation to be performed on the
output of the plugin in producing the query's columns. The simplest
transformation is a single "*", which means no transformation at all
(i.e. relay to the output table exactly the output of the plugin).

Since plugins may produce any object (for example, a JSON object with
nested fields), VQL column specifications can dereference nested
fields within the produced data.

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT Sys.Mtim.Sec from glob(globs="/bin/*")


Specifying only selected columns can limit the number of columns
produced and make the output more useful by removing unneeded
fields. For example the following will produce a result table with two
columns named FullPath and SIze and a row per file found in the /bin/
directory:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT FullPath, Size from glob(globs="/bin/*")

Column specifications can consist of arbitrary expressions - for
example addition, comparisons:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT FullPath + '.bindir', Size from glob(globs="/bin/*") WHERE Size < 1000

In this case it is often useful to add a Column Alias (Note that
column aliases can also be used in the WHERE clause):

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT FullPath + '.bindir' as Santized, Size from glob(globs="/bin/*")

VQL Functions provide a way to extend VQL expressions. Unlike full
plugins they do not produce a sequence of rows, but simply produce a
single value (which can be an arbitrary o function formats a timestamp
as a string. This is useful since many plugins produce times in
seconds since epoch time:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT FullPath, timestamp(epoch=Sys.Mtim.Sec) as mtimefrom glob(globs="/bin/*")

.. note::

   Some VQL functions have side effects, or are more expensive to
   run. It is important to understand that VQL transforms the columns
   emitted from a plugin BEFORE it applies filtering conditions. This
   is needed in order to allow for column transformations to
   participate in the filter condition (via the alias).

   Due to this order of operations the following query will upload all
   files, ignoring the WHERE condition because the upload() function
   will be evaluated on each row, even if the WHERE clause causes the
   row to be ignored:

   .. code-block:: sql

      SELECT FullPath, upload(path=FullPath)
       from glob(globs="/bin/*")
            WHERE Name =~ "bash"

   To upload only the files matching the expression, the query must be
   split into two - the first query applies the filtering condition
   and the second query does the upload:

   .. code-block:: sql

      LET files = SELECT FullPath from glob(globs="/bin/*")
          WHERE Name =~ "bash"
      SELECT FullPath, upload(path=FullPath) from files

VQL Subselects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike SQL, VQL does not have a join operator. SQL is designed to work
with databases, and databases have multiple strategies for optimizing
query execution (like adding table indexes, query planners
etc). Traditionally, SQL authors prefers joins over subselects because
in a real database JOIN operations are more optimized to use the
database's indexes and query optimizer. However JOIN operations are
arguably harder to read and it is hard to predict the order at where
operations will be run (e.g. which table will use an index and which
will use a row scan).

Since VQL has no indexes nor does it have a query optimizer,
implementing JOIN operations does not make sense. Instead, VQL
implements subselects and multi-statement queries and using these
tools it is possible for VQL authors to precisely control the query
execution plan so it is most efficient.

In this sense VQL authors are left to specify the most efficient
course of query execution themselves instead of relying on a query
optimizer. This is normally done by dividing the query into smaller
queries and combining their results in the best order.

Consider the following query that attempts to search small files for
the keyword "foobar":

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT FullPath from glob(globs="/bin/*") where
       grep(path=FullPath, keywords=["foobar"]) and Size < 1000

Velociraptor will execute the following steps:

1. Run the glob() plugin to produce all the files in the /bin/ directory
2. Transform each row to produce the FullPath.
3. Evaluate the Filter condition on each row. The filter condition
   requires running the grep() plugin on each file looking for the
   keyword and evaluating if the SIze of the file is less than 1000.
4. If both conditions are TRUE then Velociraptor will emit the row into the result table.

It is obvious that this is an inefficient query because each and every
file will be searched for the keyword regardless of its size. However,
there is no point even trying if the file size is not less than 1000
bytes!

The problem here is that there are two conditions which both must be
true - but each condition has a different cost associated with
it. Clearly the grep() condition is more expensive since it requires
opening the file and reading it completely. The Size condition is
extremely cheap since it is just an integer comparison.

However, VQL is not aware of the relative cost of the two conditions -
it does not know that grep() is inherently an expensive operation
since to VQL it just looks like another function. Although VQL does
some shortcutting (for example it will cancel the grep() function if
Size >= 1000) this shortcut cancellation may arrive too late to stop
grep() from doing a significant amount of work. The VQL author must be
aware of the relative costs of the different operations and how the
query should be structured for maximum efficiency.

What we would really like is for VQL to evaluate the cheap condst, and
only for those files smaller than 1000 bytes, evaluate the grep()
condition. This allows us to eliminate most files immediately (since
most files are larger than 1000 bytes) such that we only bother to
grep() very few files.

This can be achieved by splitting the query into two and chaining them
together:

.. code-block:: sql

   LET file = select * from glob(globs="/bin/*") WHERE Size < 1000

   SELECT FullPath from file WHERE grep(
      path=FullPath, keywords=["foobar"])

The LET keyword allows us to define a "stored query". A Stored Query
is a query which is assigned into a variable name - you can think of
the statement as running the entire query and storing the output into
a single variable.

The second query then takes the result of this query and applies
further transformations and filtering on it. By ensuring that the
cheap conditions are evaluated in the stored query, we can ensure that
the number of rows stored in the LET expression is smaller than the
total number of rows produced by the glob() plugin, and therefore the
grep() function will be applied on few rows.

.. note::

   You can think of stored queries as running in multiple steps: First
   the LET query is executed, then all its rows are stored in the
   files variable, while the second query reads each row and applies
   its own filtering on it. In reality though, the LET query is lazy
   in its evaluation and will only produce results when
   required. Velociraptor does not store the entire result table of
   the LET query in memory at once! It is quite safe therefore to run
   a very large query in the LET clause without fear of memory
   overrun.

Escaping parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VQL queries often need to take user input. For example consider the
query:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT FullPath from glob(globs="/bin/*")

We might want to allow the user to specify the glob expression and
create the query programmatically. While it is possible to ensure user
input is escaped this is inefficient and tedious.

VQL queries have an "Environment". The Environment is essentially the
evaluation scope of the query - in other words it contains all the
values which can be accessed by name. For example when we call a VQL
function like timestamp(), it is placed in the evaluation scope. It is
possible to place anything in the environment (or the evaluation
scope) and in particular, user parameters can also be placed there. In
this case there is no need to escape user input as it is treated as a
part of the environment and not the query. For example placing
`PATH="/bin/*"` into the environment, will allow the following query to
run successfully:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT FullPath from glob(globs=PATH)

You should always try to write VQL queries referring to parameters in
the environment because this makes them reusable - the scope
parameters become inputs to your query and the query becomes a
reusable function.
