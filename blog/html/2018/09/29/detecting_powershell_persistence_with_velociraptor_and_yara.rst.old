.. admonition:: Update

          As of the latest release of Velociraptor we have raw
          registry parsing which can also be done via raw NTFS to get
          around file locking. It is no longer necessary to run yara
          scans and parse with regripper as shown here.

I was watching the SANS DFIR Summit 2018 videos on youtube and came
across Mari DeGrazia's talk titled `"Finding and Decoding Malicious Powershell Scripts" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC7fzhvAY8>`_.
This is an excellent talk and it really contains
a wealth of information. It seems that Powershell is really popular
these days, allowing attacker to "live off the land" by installing
fully functional reverse shells and backdoors, in a few lines of
obfuscated scripts.


Mari went through a number of examples and also expanded on some in
her blog post `Malicious PowerShell in the Registry: Persistence <http://az4n6.blogspot.com/2018/06/malicious-powershell-in-registry.html>`_, where
she documents persistence through an autorun key launching powershell
to execute a payload within another registry key.

A similar persistence mechanism is documented by David Kennedy from
Binary defence in his post `PowerShell Injection with Fileless Payload Persistence and Bypass Techniques <https://blog.binarydefense.com/powershell-injection-diskless-persistence-bypass-techniques>`_. In that case an msha.exe link was
stored in the user's Run key which executed a payload from another
registry key.

I was eager to write a Velociraptor artifact to attempt to detect such
keys using a YARA signature. Of course signature based detection is
not as robust as behavioural analysis but it is quick and usually
quite effective.

I thought it was still quite instructive to document how one can
develop the VQL queries for a simple Velociraptor artifact. We will be
developing the artifact interactively on a Windows system.

Preparation
-----------

Our artifact will attempt to detect the persistence mechanism detailed
in the above posts. We start by adding a value to our test user
account under the key

.. code-block:: console

    Key: "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
    Value: "C:\Windows\system32\mshta.exe"
    Data:
      about:<script>c1hop="X642N10";R3I=new%20ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
      QR3iroUf="I7pL7";k9To7P=R3I.RegRead("HKCU\\software\\bkzlq\\zsdnhepyzs");
      J7UuF1n="Q2LnLxas";eval(k9To7P);JUe5wz3O="zSfmLod";</script>

Defining the Artifact.
----------------------

We create a directory called "artifacts" then create a new file inside
it called powershell_persistence.yaml. Velociraptor artifacts are just
YAML files that can be loaded at runtime using the --definitions flag.

Every artifact has a name, by convention the name is separated into
its major categories. We will call ours
Windows.Persistence.Powershell:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Windows.Persistence.Powershell

This is the minimum required for Velociraptor to identify it. We can
see a listing of all artifacts Velociraptor knows about using the
"artifacts list" command:

.. code-block:: console

    F:\>velociraptor.exe --definitions artifacts artifacts list
    INFO:2018/09/28 07:59:40 Loaded 34 built in artifacts
    Linux.Applications.Chrome.Extensions
    Linux.Applications.Chrome.Extensions.Upload
    â€¦
    Windows.Persistence.Powershell
    ...
    Windows.Sys.Users

We can collect the artifact simply by using the "artifacts collect"
command:

.. code-block:: console

    F:\>velociraptor.exe --definitions artifacts artifacts collect Windows.Persistence.Powershell
    INFO:2018/09/28 20:01:32 Loaded 34 built in artifacts

Ok so Velociraptor can load and collect this new artifact, but as yet
it does nothing! We need to think about what exactly we want to
collect.

We know we want to search for all values in the Run/RunOnce hive of
all the users. Let's first see if we can retrieve all the values using
a glob:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Windows.Persistence.Powershell
    parameters:
      - name: keyGlob
        default: "HKEY_USERS\\*\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\
        \\CurrentVersion\\{Run,RunOnce}\\*"
    sources:
     - precondition:
        SELECT OS from info() where OS = "windows"
       queries:
       - |
        SELECT FullPath from glob(
           globs=keyGlob,
           accessor="reg"
        )

This artifact demonstrates a few concepts:

1. We can define parameters by name, and reference them from within
   the VQL query. This keeps the VQL query clean and more readable.

2. We can define a precondition on the artifact. If the precondition
   is not met, the VQL query will not be run.


Lets run this artifact:

.. code-block:: console

    F:\>velociraptor.exe --definitions artifacts artifacts collect Windows.Persistence.Powershell
    INFO:2018/09/28 20:51:47 Loaded 34 built in artifacts

    | 32\mshta.exe"                  |
    +--------------------------------+
    Artifact:
    Windows.Persistence.Powershell

It returns a couple of results so there are two Run/RunOnce values
defined. For this artifact, we only want to return those entries which
match a specific yara signature. We can work later on improving the
yara signature, but for now let's just detect uses of the eval()
powershell command within 500 characters of an ActiveXObject
instantiation. We will try to match each value returned from the Run
keys with this object:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Windows.Persistence.Powershell
    parameters:
      - name: keyGlob
        default: "HKEY_USERS\\*\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\
                 \\CurrentVersion\\{Run,RunOnce}\\*"
      - name: yaraRule
        default: |
          rule Powershell {
            strings:
            $ = /ActiveXObject.{,500}eval/ nocase
            $ = /ActiveXObject.{,500}eval/ wide nocase
            condition:
            any of them
          }
    sources:
     - precondition:
        SELECT OS from info() where OS = "windows"
       queries:
       - |
         // This is a stored query
         LET file = SELECT FullPath from glob(
           globs=keyGlob,
           accessor="reg"
         )
       - |
         SELECT * FROM yara(
           rules=yaraRule,
           files=file.FullPath,   // This will expand to a list of paths.
           accessor="reg")


This version recovers the FullPath of all the Run/RunOnce values and
stores them in a stored query. We then issue another query that
applies the yara rule on these values:

.. code-block:: console

We can see that the last query returns 5 columns, but each column
actually contains objects with quite a lot of additional
information. For example, the File column returns information about
the file that matched the yara rule (its filename, timestamps
etc). The output is a bit confusing so we just return the relevant
columns. We can replace the * in the last query with a curated list of
columns to return:


.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT File.FullPath as ValueName, File.Data.value as Contents,
      timestamp(epoch=File.Mtime.Sec) as ModTime
    FROM yara(rules=yaraRule,
              files=file.FullPath,
              accessor="reg")

Which results in the quite readable:

.. code-block:: console

    Artifact: Windows.Persistence.Powershell

Great! This works and only returns values that match the yara
signature we developed.

Testing the artifact
--------------------

Let's test this artifact for real now. We restart the frontend with
the --definition flag and this makes the new artifact available in the
GUI under the Artifact Collector flow. The GUI also shows the entire
artifact we defined so we can see what VQL will be run:

.. image:: powershell1.png

Launching the flow appears to work and shows exactly the same result
as we collected on the command line:

.. image:: powershell2.png


But wait! There is a problem!
-----------------------------

When we log out of the machine, and then rerun the artifact it returns
no results!

.. image:: powershell3.png

Why is that? Experienced incident responders would recognize that any
artifact that works from the `HKEY_USERS` registry hive is inherently
unreliable. This is because the `HKEY_USERS` hive is not a real hive -
it is a place where Windows mounts the user's hive when the user logs
in.

How does HKEY_USERS hive work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows implements the concept of user profiles. Each user has a
personal registry hive that stores user specific settings. It is
actually a file stored on their home directory called ntuser.dat. When
a user logs into the workstation, the file may be synced from the
domain controller and then it is mounted under the `HKEY_USERS\<sid>`
registry hive.

This means that when the user logs out, their user registry hive is
unmounted and does not appear in `HKEY_USERS` any longer. Any
artifacts based around the `HKEY_USERS` hive will work only if the
collection is run when a user is logged in.

This is obviously not what we want when we hunt for persistence! We
want to make sure that none of the users on the system have this
persistence mechanism installed. You can imagine a case where a system
has been cleaned up but then a user logs into the machine, thereby
reinfecting it!

How to fix this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yara is a very powerful tool because it allows us to search for
patterns in amorphous data (such as process memory and structured
files) without having to fully understand the structure of the data we
are searching for. Of course this has its limitations, but yara can
raise a red flag if the signature matches the file, and we can analyse
this file more carefully later.

In this case, we can not rely on globbing the `HKEY_USER` registry
hive, so maybe we can just search the files that back these hives? We
know that each user on the system has an `NTUSER.DAT` file in their
home directory (usually `C:\\Users\\<username>`), so let's write an
artifact to find these files. We can reuse the artifact
Windows.Sys.Users that reports all user accounts on a system (we
display it as JSON to enhance readability):

.. code-block:: console

    F:\>velociraptor.exe artifacts collect Windows.Sys.Users --format json
    INFO:2018/09/28 22:44:26 Loaded 34 built in artifacts
    {
     "Description": "",
     "Directory": "C:\\Users\\test",
     "Gid": 513,
     "Name": "test",
     "Type": "local",
     "UUID": "S-1-5-21-546003962-2713609280-610790815-1001",
     "Uid": 1001
    },
    {
     "Description": "",
     "Directory": "C:\\Users\\user1",
     "Gid": 513,
     "Name": "user1",
     "Type": "local",
     "UUID": "S-1-5-21-546003962-2713609280-610790815-1003",
     "Uid": 1003
    },


So we just want to YARA scan the NTUSER.DAT file in each home directory:

.. code-block:: console

     SELECT * from foreach(
     row={
        SELECT Name, Directory as HomeDir
          FROM Artifact.Windows.Sys.Users()
         WHERE Directory.value and Gid
     },
     query={
       SELECT File.FullPath As FullPath,
              Strings.Offset AS Off,
              Strings.HexData As Hex,
               upload(file=File.FullPath, accessor="ntfs") AS Upload
           FROM yara(
                 files="\\\\.\\" + HomeDir + "\\ntuser.dat",
                 accessor="ntfs",
                 rules=yaraRule, context=10)
           })

This query:

1. Selects all the usernames and their home directory from the
   Windows.Sys.Users artifact.

2. For each directory prepends `\\\\.\\` and appends "ntuser.dat". For
   example `c:\\Users\\test` becomes
   `\\\\.\\c:\\Users\\test\\NTUSER.dat`

3. The file is accessed using the NTFS filesystem accessor. This is
   necessary because the registry hive is locked if the user is logged
   in. Therefore we must access it using raw NTFS parsing to bypass
   the OS locking.

4. For each file that matches the yara expression, we upload the file
   to the server for further analysis.


Lets run this new artifact on the server:

.. image:: powershell5.png

Unlike the previous artifact, this one simply returns the YARA hit,
but because we do not have any context on which value contained the
signature, or even if it had been deleted. Luckily we uploaded the raw
registry hive for further analysis, and we can use a tool such as
RegRipper to extract more information from the hive:

.. code-block:: console

    $ wine rip.exe -p user_run -r
    /tmp/velociraptor/clients/C.c916a7e445eb0868/uploads/F.078739d6/ntfs/

Note above how we can simply retrieve the uploaded file from
Velociraptor's filestore. Velociraptor stores uploaded files on the
filesystem within the flow's directory.

Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~

In this blog post we saw how to utilize YARA to find suspicious
powershell persistence mechanisms. YARA is a powerful tool and using
Velociraptor's artifacts we can apply it to files, registry values,
and raw NTFS files such as locked registry hives and the pagefile.

We also saw some of the inherent problems with relying on the
`HKEY_USERS` registry hive for detection - the hive is only present
when a user is logged in so when we hunt, we might miss those users
who are currently logged out. We saw how `YARA` can be used to detect
suspicious patterns in raw registry hive files and how artifacts may
retrieve those files for further analysis.
