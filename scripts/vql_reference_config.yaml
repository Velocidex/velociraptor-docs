  linktitle: Basic VQL
  description: |
    VQL provides a basic set of functions and plugins allowing
    queries to manipulate data and implement logic. This page details
    those plugins which are considered foundational to the VQL
    language and therefore may be useful in all types of artifacts.

    {{% notice note %}}
    VQL plugins are not the same as VQL functions. A plugin is the subject
    of the VQL query - i.e. plugins always follow the `FROM` keyword,
    while functions (which return a single value instead of a sequence of
    rows) are only present in column specification (e.g. after `SELECT`)
    or in condition clauses (i.e. after the `WHERE` keyword).

  description: |
    Many Velociraptor artifacts rely on specialized parsing of file
    formats. This page outlines all the plugins and functions designed
    to allow the client to parse information for various files.

    Simple file formats may be parsed using regular expressions and
    other generic rules. However some specialized file formats have
    dedicated parsers. These dedicated parsers are exported into VQL
    plugins so their results may be used in further queries.

  description: |
    Velociraptor provides complete control of the server within VQL
    queries. On the server, the VQL engine contains the following
    plugins and functions. You can use this functionality to manage
    and automate the server by writing VQL queries.

    To reuse server side artifacts, simply create an artifact with
    `type: SERVER` and launch it from the "Server Artifacts" screen in
    the GUI.

  description: |
    This page lists the plugins used to collect information from
    clients.

    VQL plugins are the data sources of VQL queries. While SQL queries
    refer to static tables of data, VQL queries refer to plugins, which
    generate data rows to be filtered by the query.

    Unlike SQL, VQL plugins also receive keyword arguments. When the
    plugin is evaluated it simply generates a sequence of rows which are
    further filtered by the query.

    This allows VQL statements to be chained naturally since plugin args
    may also be other queries.

  title: Event Plugins
  description: |
    VQL Event plugins are plugins which never terminate - but instead
    generate rows based on events. Event plugins are useful for creating
    client monitoring artifacts. Currently, client side monitoring
    artifacts are specified in the `Events` section of the server
    configuration file. When clients connect to the server, they receive a
    list of monitoring artifacts they are to run. The client runs all
    artifacts in parallel and their results are streamed to the server.
