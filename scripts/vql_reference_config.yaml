  linktitle: Frequently Used
  description: |
    These are the functions and plugins that are the most frequently used in
    [Velociraptor's built-in artifacts](/artifact_references/) and the
    [Community Exchange artifacts](/exchange/). So we can infer that these are
    the most "popular" and therefore probably the most useful ones for everyday
    artifact writing.

    VQL provides a vast array of functions and plugins allowing queries to
    manipulate data and implement logic. Many are suitable for specific use
    cases, however most on this page are considered foundational to the VQL
    language. They are the general purpose VQL "workhorses", which is why they
    are frequently used in the existing artifacts.

    If you are new to VQL then this is a good place to start and become
    acquainted with the commonly used functions and plugins.

  description: |
    Velociraptor provides complete control of the server within VQL queries. On
    the server the VQL engine contains the following plugins and functions
    which you can use to manage and automate the server via VQL queries. Such
    server-side VQL can be run via Server Artifacts, Notebooks, or the API.

    Since these rely on the server datastore and server services they are not
    available on clients!

  title: Parsers
  linktitle: Parsers
  description: |
    Many Velociraptor artifacts rely on parsing of file and data formats.

    Velociraptor has dedicated parsers for some specialized file and data
    formats. In addition we have flexible generic parsers, such as `grok` and
    other regex-based parsers for text formats, and `parse_binary` which
    provides completely customizable parsing of binary file formats.

  description: |
    VQL Event plugins are plugins which never terminate - but instead generate
    rows based on events.

    Event plugins are useful for creating monitoring artifacts, both on clients
    and on the server.

  description: |
    Velociraptor is evolving quickly. We sometimes implement functionality which
    may not be broadly useful and therefore might not remain in Velociraptor for
    the long-term. This page lists such 'experimental' features.

    If you find them useful, please let us know so that we don't remove them!
