Best-effort checks are made using the built-in **-GetPreReqs** flag. This is an initial PoC, and as such, much testing is needed, and feedback is welcome.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nhttps://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam\n\n**Description:**\n\nInvoke-AtomicRedTeam is a PowerShell module to execute tests as defined in the atomics folder of Red Canary's Atomic Red Team project. The \"atomics folder\" contains a folder for each Technique defined by the MITRE ATT&CK\u2122 Framework. Inside of each of these \"T#\" folders you'll find a yaml file that defines the attack procedures for each atomic test as well as an easier to read markdown (md) version of the same data.\n\n- Executing atomic tests may leave your system in an undesirable state. You are responsible for understanding what a test does before executing.\n\n- Ensure you have permission to test before you begin.\n\n- It is recommended to set up a test machine for atomic test execution that is similar to the build in your environment. Be sure you have your collection/EDR solution in place, and that the endpoint is checking in and active.\n",
