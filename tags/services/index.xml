 Service Executable Hijacking is a misconfiguration flaw, where a service runs an executable which has 
 overly permissive permissions on it (for example: "Full Control" permissions to "Authenticated Users").
 If a service runs under the security context of a user with high permissions (such as: NT Authority\SYSTEM), 
 and an attacker with low privileges is able to modify the executable that service is running (such as 
 replacing it with their own) - the service could run that executable with high privileges.
 
 This hunt finds all Windows services which are vulnerable to service executable hijacking. 
 It does so in the following manner:
 1. Enumerate all services, and extract the full path of their executables.
 2. Run an external Powershell script to enumerate the ACLs of those executables.
 3. Display all relevant information regarding found vulnerable services.
