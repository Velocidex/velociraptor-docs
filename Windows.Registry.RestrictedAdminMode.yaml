name: Windows.Registry.RestrictedAdminMode
author: Sikha Puthanveedu @SikhaMohan

description: |
  This artifact checks the registry key:
  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\DisableRestrictedAdmin
  and retrieves its details, including modification time.

  This key controls Restricted Admin Mode, a security feature that can be exploited by threat actors. 
  A DWORD value of 0 for this key enables Restricted Admin Mode, allowing attackers with local administrator privileges to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when moving laterally within the victim network.
 
  **If this artifact detects a value of 0, further investigation is recommended.** Disabling Restricted Admin Mode might be a necessary security response.
