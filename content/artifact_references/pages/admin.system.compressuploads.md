hidden: true
tags: [Server Event Artifact]

Compresses all uploaded files.

When artifacts collect files they are normally stored on the server
uncompressed. This artifact watches all completed flows and
compresses the files in the file store when the flow completes. This
is very useful for cloud based deployments with limited storage
space or when collecting large files.

In order to run this artifact you would normally run it as part of
an artifact acquisition process:

```
$ velociraptor --config /etc/server.config.yaml artifacts acquire Admin.System.CompressUploads
```

Note that there is nothing special about compressed files - you can
also just run `find` and `gzip` in the file store. Velociraptor will
automatically decompress the file when displaying it in the GUI
text/hexdump etc.
