This artifact extracts PuTTY SSH host keys.

As a security measure PuTTY and its companion utilities PSCP, PSFTP, and Plink 
records the host key for each server connected to, in the Windows Registry.

- Output KeyName: ssh-ed12345@22:27.27.27.27
- To search for a specific IP: TargetKeyName =~ ':\<IP\>$'
- To search for a specific PORT: TargetKeyName =~ '@\<PORT\>:.+$'
