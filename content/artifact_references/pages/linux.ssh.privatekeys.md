SSH Private keys can be either encrypted or unencrypted. Unencrypted
private keys are more risky because an attacker can use them without
needing to unlock them with a password.

In particular, AWS instances are usually accessed by way of an SSH
key pair generated by the AWS console. This key is not encrypted by
default and it is possible that administrators simply save the key
on their systems without encrypting it.

This artifact searches for private keys in the usual locations and
also records if they are encrypted or not. Not all key types are
supported

NOTE: In order to encrypt your private key run:

```
ssh-keygen -p -f my_private_key
```

Change the glob to /** if you would like to search the entire filesystem.
Be aware, this is an expensive operation.
