{{% notice note "Support for Windows 7" %}}

Golang has officially [ended support for Windows
7](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57003) with the Go 1.20
release. Current builds do not support this platform.

The Windows 7 binaries mentioned above are built with the deprecated
Go 1.20 release which is known to work on Windows 7.

However, note the following caveats:

* To build under this unsupported Go version we had to freeze
  dependencies. Therefore this build includes known buggy and
  unsupported dependencies.

* This build may be insecure! since it includes unsupported
  dependencies.

* We typically update to the latest version of Velociraptor but it may
  be that in future we disable some feature (VQL plugins) that can not
  be easily updated.


**Do not use this build in a general deployment!** Only use it for
deploying on deprecated, unsupported operating systems:

* Windows 7
* Windows 8, 8.1
