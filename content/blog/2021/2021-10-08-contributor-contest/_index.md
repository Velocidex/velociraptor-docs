The 2021 Velociraptor Contributor Competition has drawn to a close and
this year we have received 6 excellent submissions. Each submission
pushes the state of the art in DFIR and enhance Velociraptor's
capabilities. Without our wonderful community, an open source project,
such as Velociraptor would not be nearly as capable.

We will announce the winners at the SANS Threat Hunting Summit but
until then, take a look at the submissions, and decide for yourself
who the winners are!

## Justin Welgemoed

This submission demonstrates how Velociraptor can be used to automate
collection, analysis and post processing using a combination of client
and server artifacts. Justin has also re-purposed the GUI to automate
further processing of files by signature identification using tools
such as GENE and CAPA for further triaging.
