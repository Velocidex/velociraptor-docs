The 2021 Velociraptor Contributor Competition has drawn to a close and
this year we have received 6 excellent submissions. Each submission
pushes the state of the art in DFIR and enhances Velociraptor's
capabilities. Without our wonderful Community an open source project
such as Velociraptor would not be nearly as capable.

# And the winners are...

We are thrilled to announce the winners of the Competition!  Each of these
submissions separated itself from the pack by earning the top combined
ratings in five key selection criteria:<br><br> Usefulness, Creativity,
Effort/Difficulty, Completeness of Solution and Clarity of Documentation
<br><br>

Without further ado, the winners are...

* Grand Prize ($5,000 USD) - **Justin Welgemoed**
* Second Place ($3,000 USD) - **Eduardo Cunha Mattos**
* Third Place ($2,000 USD) - **Josh Brower**

Congratulations to all three winners!  We'll be reaching out soon with details
on how to claim your prizes.  The Velociraptor team would also like to
sincerely thank all the judges for their valuable time and effort in evaluating
the submissions.  A great big shoutout and thanks to all our Community members
who submitted entries as well.

## Justin Welgemoed

This submission demonstrates how Velociraptor can be used to automate
collection, analysis and post processing using a combination of client
and server artifacts. Justin has also re-purposed the GUI to automate
further processing of files by signature identification using tools
such as `GENE` and `CAPA` for further triaging.
