Hunting and responding like a raptor!
=====================================

At Velocidex we have been running open source endpoint monitoring tools
for our clients in order to detect and respond to incidents. One of our
favorite tools is GRR, developed by Google internally and then released
as open source. GRR is a very powerful tool, with a polished UI and good
documentation.

Unfortunately the open source version released by Google suffers from
some shortcomings and so we have decided to develop a new project, built
on the shoulders of giants called Velociraptor.

These are Velociraptor\'s design goals:

 -   Focus on data collection. Velociraptor\'s primary use case is to
     collect data and export it to other systems. Velociraptor does no
     analysis itself and therefore has no need for a complex data
     model.
 -   Flexibility - Velociraptor can adapt easily to new requirements
     without needing to redeploy either clients or servers. Using VQL
     (Velocidex Query Language) provides flexibility in the type and
     number of queries that are used to rapidly adapt to changing
     requirements. VQL allows us to collect just the information needed
     and no more in an adaptive way.
 -   Remove abstractions. Velociraptor aims to be as simple to
     understand as possible. The default data store simply stores files
     in the file system which may be easily inspected by the user. No
     special tooling is required to script or manage Velociraptor.
     Reduce demand on the data store. Rather than increase the data
     store requirements, we want to simplify the design to the point
     that requirements on the data store are so low, one can run a
     medium to large sized deployment with very few resources (down to
     perhaps a single server machine). In fact the default data store
     does not even use a database, but simply uses flat files.
 -   Simplify everything! Velociraptor aims to be very simple to run
     and administer. We remove a lot of the GRR functionality that we
     dont find we use often. Velociraptor ships as a single, statically
     linked executable which can perform all actions necessary for
     deployers.

In short we really wanted something like this:

Quick Start
===========

In this section we go through a typical deployment scenario of
Velociraptor.

Download the binary
-------------------

Velociraptor ships as a single statically compiled binary. It has no
external dependencies and does not require installing as a package.
Simply download the binary from the release page for the OS you will be
deploying on. The same binary is used for the client and the server.

Generate a configuration file
-----------------------------

Velociraptor needs a configuration file to start serving requests. You
can generate a new configuration file using the velociraptor config
generate command. Note that this prints a new configuration into stdout
so you might want to redirect it into a new file (NOTE: The file
contains key material so ensure it has appropriate permissions). Below
we highlight the parameters you will probably want to change:

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
$ velociraptor config generate | tee /etc/velociraptor.config.yaml
Client:
  server_urls:
    - http://localhost:8000/
  writeback_linux: /etc/velociraptor.writeback.yaml
  writeback_windows: /Program Files/Velociraptor/velociraptor.writeback.yaml
Datastore:
  filestore_directory: /tmp/velociraptor
  implementation: FileBaseDataStore
  location: /tmp/velociraptor
Frontend:
  bind_address: 127.0.0.1
  bind_port: 8000
GUI:
  bind_address: 127.0.0.1
  bind_port: 8889
```

The configuration file contains default values for most settings and new
keys for cryptographic material so it is expected that you edit the file
to customize it for your local deployment. The config file is divided
into sections. Here is a quick overview:

-   The Client section is used to configure clients.
    -   Server\_urls is a list of URLs the client will attempt to
        connect to. If a connection to one fails it will try the others
        repeatedly. It is wise to include several URLs here or at least
        a DNS name so the server may be easily t just use a single IP
        address here). This will usually be different from Frontend bind
        address in a proper deployment but for testing it may be the
        same.
    -   Writeback: The writeback path is where clients will write their
        local persistent state (for example, their private keys). You
        can specify a different location for windows, osx and linux
        clients.
-   The Datastore section specifies where to store the data for the
    server. Be sure to update the location to a more permanent path. The
    filestore\_location is a path that receives uploaded files which may
    be large.
-   The Frontend is the server component which receives poll messages
    from clients. It should be exposed to the internet on a public
    interface so clients may reach it. This section also contains the
    server\'s certificate as signed by the CA (you can rotate server
    keys using the velociraptor config rotate\_keys command.
-   The GUI is the Velociraptor web admin UI. Do not expose this on a
    public interface without enabling TLS! We recommend to only enable
    it on the loopback interface and use SSH tunneling to access it over
    HTTP.server

Client configuration
--------------------

Clients receive a subset of the complete configuration which enables
them to connect to the server. You can extract the client\'s
configuration using the velociraptor config client command.

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
$ velociraptor --config /etc/velociraptor.config.yaml config client
Client:
 ca_certificate: |
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   MIIDIDCCAgigAwIBAgIQEPaF6CPMLOlixEmpgHhvsTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAa
   abIwLMojhIxVFXZOZ0p2ZhYkeKJwNGbiA9rBJR2iKxeJOa0B
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

 nonce: UwtTRfezXIU=
  server_urls:
 - http://localhost:8000/
  writeback_linux: /etc/velociraptor.writeback.yaml
  writeback_windows: /Program Files/Velociraptor/velociraptor.writeback.yaml
```

Running the server
------------------

Start the server using the frontend command:

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
$ velociraptor --config velociraptor.config.yaml frontend

INFO:2018/08/08 15:39:09 Launched gRPC API server on 127.0.0.1:8888
INFO:2018/08/08 15:39:09 GUI is ready to handle requests at 127.0.0.1:8889
INFO:2018/08/08 15:39:09 Frontend is ready to handle client requests at 127.0.0.1:8000
```

You can now verify the server is working by connecting to the GUI with a
web browser:

Running the client
------------------

The client is run using the s configuration

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
$ velociraptor --config /etc/velociraptor.client.config.yaml client
velociraptor: error: Unable to load writeback file: open /etc/velociraptor.writeback.yaml: no such file or directory

INFO:2018/08/08 16:02:27 Received response with status: 200 OK
```

We can see that when a new client starts for the first time it goes
through a number of steps:

1.  The writeback file is created with a new client private key (and a
    client ID).
2.  The client communicates with the server but receives a 406 status.
    This initiates the enrolment flow.
3.  The server schedules an Interrogate flow on the client, which issues
    a number of VQL queries.
4.  We can now search for the client using the GUI search box.

Introducing Velociraptor
------------------------

This post introduces Velociraptor - a new end point monitoring and IR
tool built upon GRR\'s groundwork and experience. To be clear, we reused
some of GRR\'s code and some design elements, but Velociraptor is a new
project and is largely a rewrite of GRR\'s codebase. Like GRR,
Velociraptor is released under an open source license and is a community
project hosted on <https://gitlab.com/velocidex/velociraptor>.

It is still very early days and we would love to receive feedback and
suggestions. This is the first technology preview release and we hope to
make a more stable and comprehensive release in the coming months. As
Velociraptor becomes more battle tested we hope the codebase will
stabilize.

The near term roadmap is:

-   Improve support for more operating systems. Especially Windows:
-   Registry based VQL plugins.
-   NTFS support for raw disk access.
-   Memory scanning and rudimentary Memory analysis
-   Design a more efficient client/server communication mechanism - long
    polling is problematic since clients only poll infrequently (e.g.
    every 10 minutes). We want to be able to control all clients
    quickly.
-   Develop a library of VQL expressions which may be reusable. This
    should be similar to GRR\'s idea of Artifacts but be more geared
    towards VQL.

Please play with it and send feedback to
<velociraptor-discuss@googlegroups.com>
