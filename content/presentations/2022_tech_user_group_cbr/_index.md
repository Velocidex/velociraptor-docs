## Digging Deeper with Velociraptor

[Join us for a Live Workshop on Digging Deeper with Velociraptor | Cliftons Canberra
Thursday, 28 July 2022 @ 4pm - 6:30pm AEST](https://information.rapid7.com/digging-deeper-velociraptor-workshop_registration.html)

With an increasingly mobile and remote workforce, the old manual
approach to incident response does not scale. The dwell time of
ransomware operators is now measured in days and weeks, making the
need for fast effective response critical.

Welcome to the age of Velociraptor - the new open source DFIR
visibility tool everyone has been talking about! Velociraptor is
powered by a flexible and powerful query language, allowing you to
rapidly go from an advisory or a new hunting idea, to getting
actionable data in minutes. Then, you can leverage the power of
Velociraptor’s remediation and detection capabilities to ensure the
compromise is cleaned up and never happens again!

Join us on Thursday 28 July at Cliftons Canberra for a live workshop
and demo session followed by some networking drinks and nibbles. This
workshop is an introduction to hunting and incident response with
Velociraptor for information security professionals.

Register now to confirm your place. Spaces are limited, so please
register early.

We look forward to seeing you there!
