This talk was given at the Linux Conference 2022 remotely https://lca2022.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/58/

## Abstract

Velociraptor is the new open source DFIR framework that everyone is
talking about! Have you ever needed to respond to an incident in a
large enterprise network? Have you wondered how many of your 10,000
endpoints are compromised? You know you should be hunting for common
forensic artifacts but how do you do it in a scalable way, in a
reasonable time? Wellâ€¦ now you can!

This talk will introduce Velociraptor and cover specifically the
recent capabilities investigating and monitoring the security of Linux
hosts. Velociraptor's superpower is its flexible and powerful query
language called VQL. Using VQL we can implement novel detection, hunt
for compromise and automate all our response needs. We cover some
common use cases such as hunting for ssh keys across large networks or
automatic escalation when suspicious events are discovered. We also
cover real time monitoring of the endpoint (for example webshell
detection via process parent/child analysis) and how VQL can be used
to build sophisticated alerting around process execution chains,
network connections and even bash instrumentation of the command line,
all done at scale with the click of a few buttons.
