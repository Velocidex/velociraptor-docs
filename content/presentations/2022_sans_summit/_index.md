## How to unlock achievements in Threat Hunting using Velociraptor

Velociraptor is the open source DFIR framework that everyone is
talking about! Have you ever needed to respond to an incident in a
large enterprise network? Have you wondered how many of your 10,000
endpoints are compromised? You know you should be hunting for common
forensic artifacts but how do you do it in a scalable way, in a
reasonable time? Well… now you can!

This session will introduce Velociraptor and cover the recent
capabilities investigating and monitoring the security of Linux and
Windows hosts. Velociraptor’s superpower is its flexible and powerful
query language called VQL. Using VQL we can implement novel detection,
hunt for compromise and automate all our response needs. We will cover
common use cases such as hunting for ssh keys across large networks or
automatic escalation when suspicious events are discovered. We also
cover real time monitoring of the endpoint (for example webshell
detection via process parent/child analysis) and how VQL can be used
to build sophisticated alerting around process execution chains,
network connections and even bash instrumentation of the command line,
all done at scale with the click of a few buttons.
