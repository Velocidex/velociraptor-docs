Welcome to Velociraptor's Documentation site.

{{% children %}}

After learning how Velociraptor's VQL artifacts can be used to gain
unprecedented visibility into the endpoint, continue on to consulting
the [VQL reference](/vql_reference) on this site.

If you are simply looking for an artifact to learn about how VQL can
used in many different situations, visit our
[Artifact Exchange](/exchange) to share the artifacts.


Finally check out the Velociraptor [Blog](/blog) for articles about
using Velociraptor in different scenarios and to learn more about
Velociraptor's features.
