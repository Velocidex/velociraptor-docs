Artifacts can have ZERO or more sources.
It may seem strange at first to think about artifact with no sources, however this allows for some interesting use cases, for example:
- export-imports
    - shared variables
    - shared custom functions and plugins
    - shared parameter values (because parameters are really preset variables)
- defining server event queues
- documentation (using description-only artifacts)
- storing tool definitions
