Velociraptor is a unique, advanced open-source endpoint monitoring,
digital forensic and cyber response platform.

It was developed by Digital Forensic and Incident Response (DFIR) professionals who needed a
powerful and efficient way to hunt for specific artifacts and monitor activities across
fleets of endpoints. Velociraptor provides you with the ability to more effectively respond to a wide range of digital
forensic and cyber incident response investigations and data breaches:

* Reconstruct attacker activities through digital forensic analysis
* Hunt for evidence of sophisticated adversaries
* Investigate malware outbreaks and other suspicious network activities
* Monitory continuously for suspicious user activities, such as files
  copied to USB devices
* Discover whether disclosure of confidential information occurred outside the network
* Gather endpoint data over time for use in threat hunting and
  future investigations


## VQL - the Velociraptor difference

Velociraptor's power and flexibility comes from the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL). VQL is a framework for creating highly customized **artifacts**, which allow you to collect, query, and monitor almost any aspect of an endpoint, groups of endpoints, or an entire network. It can also be used to create continuous monitoring
rules on the endpoint, as well as automate tasks on the server.
