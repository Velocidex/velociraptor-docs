Velociraptor is a unique, advanced open-source endpoint monitoring,
digital forensic and cyber response platform.

It was originally developed by DFIR professionals who needed a
powerful and efficient way to hunt and monitor activities across
fleets of endpoints for specific artefacts, in a wide range of digital
forensic and cyber incident response investigations such as:

* Responding to data breaches
* Reconstructing attacker activities through digital forensic analysis
* Hunting for evidence of sophisticated adversaries
* Investigating malware outbreaks and other suspicious network activities
* Continual monitoring for suspicious user activities, such as files
  copies to USB devices
* Disclosure of confidential information outside the network
* Gathering endpoint data over time, for use in threat hunting and
  future investigations.


## VQL - the Velociraptor difference

Velociraptor is a unique DFIR tool, giving you power and flexibility
through the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) VQL is used for
everything in Velociraptor not only in order to query the endpoint
itself. For example, VQL can be used to create continuous monitoring
rules on the endpoint, as well as automate tasks on the server.

The most powerful feature of Velociraptor is its framework for
creating highly customized **artifacts** which allow a user to
collect, query and monitor almost any aspect of a single endpoint,
groups of endpoints or an entire network.
