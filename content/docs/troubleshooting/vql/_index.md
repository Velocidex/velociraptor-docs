## General advice

1. We recommend that you develop your new queries in a [Velociraptor notebook]().

2. If you're having problems or unexpected outcomes then try to reduce your VQL to
it's simplest form.

3. For issues concerning plugins and functions, always refer to the [VQL
   Reference] and ensure that you're supplying all the required parameters in
   that their data types are correct (see the section on
   [Inspecting Data types](#inspecting-data-types) below).
