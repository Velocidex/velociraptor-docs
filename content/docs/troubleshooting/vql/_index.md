  * Advice for basic troubleshooting of VQL queries.
---

## General advice

1. We recommend that you develop your new queries in a
   [Velociraptor notebook]({{< ref "/docs/notebooks/" >}}).

2. If you're having problems or unexpected outcomes then try to reduce your VQL
   to it's simplest form. If possible, try to isolate the problematic part of
   the VQL query and test it in a notebook cell.

3. For issues concerning plugins and functions, always refer to the
   [VQL Reference]({{< ref "/vql_reference/" >}})
   and ensure that you're supplying all the required parameters, and that their
   data types are correct (see the section on
   [Inspecting Data types](#inspecting-data-types) below).
