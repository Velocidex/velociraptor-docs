Sometimes things don't work when you first try them. ðŸ˜“

This section provides strategies and steps for troubleshooting the most common
issues that people encounter when deploying and using Velociraptor.

{{% notice tip "Are you running the latest version?" %}}

Velociraptor development moves fast, but stability and bug fixes are a top
priority for us! So before you begin troubleshooting, it's always worth checking
that you're running the latest version, just in case your issue is one that's
already been fixed.

The current version is available from our
[Downloads]({{< ref "/downloads/" >}}) page.
