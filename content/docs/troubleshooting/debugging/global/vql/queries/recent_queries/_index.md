The `Recent Queries` profile similarly shows all recent queries (even
after they completed). This helps us understand what queries had run
on the endpoint previously, and how long they took to complete.

In the `VQL` profile category there are also profiles to show all recent queries
(even ones that have completed already). This helps us to understand what
exactly the client was recently doing.
