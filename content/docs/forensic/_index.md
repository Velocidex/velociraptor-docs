In previous sections we learned the syntax of VQL. But VQL is not useful without
a good set of plugins that make DFIR work possible.

One of Velociraptor's key strengths is its wide array of
[VQL plugins, functions and accessors]({{< ref "/vql_reference/" >}})
that enable in-depth, fast, and effective DFIR investigations and detections.

In this section we look at common forensic analysis tasks and recommended ways
to accomplish them using VQL.
