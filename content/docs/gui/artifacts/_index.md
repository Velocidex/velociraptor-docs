How to find and manage artifacts

How to use the artifact editor.

When you attempt to "edit" an existing built-in artifact through the GUI, you
are actually creating a customized copy of that artifact. The GUI automatically
adds the prefix "Custom." to the name of this new customized version. This is a
deliberate design choice to prevent accidental overwriting of the original
built-in artifacts, which could cause problems during upgrades and make
troubleshooting difficult.

You cannot delete the original built-in artifacts through the GUI either; the
delete button is greyed out for them.
