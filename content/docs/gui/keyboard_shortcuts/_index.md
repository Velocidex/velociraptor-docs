The Velociraptor GUI supports many keyboard shortcuts to navigate around
quicker. So you don't have to be slowed down by mouse clicks!

The key combination `<Ctrl>` + `/` will bring up the Keyboard Shortcuts help.

The `Esc` key or clicking anywhere on the screen will close it.

### Global hotkeys

These are available on any screen in the GUI.

### Artifact Editor

These are available in the [artifact editor]({{< ref "/docs/gui/artifacts/" >}})
and Sigma editor.

The editor uses the ACE (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor) under the hood. This means that
all the ACE keyboard shortcuts listed
[here](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/default-keyboard-shortcuts) are
available in the editor, many of which are common shortcuts across many popular
text editors.

In addition, the following shortcuts are available in the editor.
