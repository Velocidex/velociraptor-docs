As a precaution, by default Velociraptor only binds the Admin GUI port
to the loopback interface. You may change the `GUI.bind_address`
setting to "0.0.0.0" to receive external connections on this
port, but this is not recommended. Instead, you should use SSH
tunneling to connect to the local loopback interface.
