## Provision a Virtual Machine

Next we provision an Ubuntu VM from any cloud provider.  The size of
your VM depends on the number of endpoints in your environment.  An 8
or 16Gb VM should be sufficient for around 5-10k clients.
Additionally you will need sufficient disk space to hold the data you
collect. We recommend starting with a modest amount of storage and
then back up data or increase the storage volume as needed.
