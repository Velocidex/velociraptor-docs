In self-signed SSL mode, Velociraptor issues its own server
certificate using its internal CA. This means the Admin GUI and front end
also use a self-signed server certificate.

## When to use this deployment mode

This type of deployment is most appropriate for on-premises scenarios
where internet access is not available or egress is blocked.

## Self-Signed Certificates

Self-signed SSL certificates trigger SSL warnings in all web
browsers. When accessing the Admin GUI you will receive a
certificate warning about the possibility of a MITM attack.



Velociraptor doesn't support other self-signed SSL certificates, and we don't
recommend attempting to add your own internal self-signed certificate to
Velociraptor.
