### Self-Signed

### Let's Encrypt

The first time you navigate to the SSL URL the server will obtain a certificate
from Let's Encrypt. There will be a small pause as this happens.

You will be redirected to Google for authentication - Velociraptor does not
handle any credentials in this configuration. Google will determine if the user
authenticated properly and display the userâ€™s email address and avatar.
