{{% notice info "SSL Intercepting proxies" %}}

By default, Velociraptor will not connect through an SSL intercepting
proxy. While not recommended, it is possible to add allow list rules
that enable Velociraptor to connect through an SSL intercepting
proxy. If you do so, you will see a certificate warning about the
possibility of a MITM attack when accessing the Admin GUI.
