The aim of the wizard is to make it easy to configure Velociraptor in the most
common deployment scenarios. Even though these scenarios will not be a perfect
fit for everyone, most users should be able to start with these deploment modes
and tweak the configuration to their specific needs.

The end result of running the configuration wizard is a YAML configuration file.
So there is no harm in doing "dry runs" and examining or comparing resulting
files to better understand how the choices affect the resulting configuration.
