### Generating configuration

To generate a self signed deployment, start by running the `config
generate` command to invoke the configuration wizard

```sh
velociraptor config generate -i
```

![Generating Cloud Deployment](config.png?classes=shadow)

The configuration wizard asks a number of questions and creates a
server and client configuration.


* **What OS will the server be deployed on?** This choice will affect the
  defaults for various options. Production deployments are typically
  done on a Linux machine (but the configuration can be generated on
  Windows).
* **Path to the datastore directory:** Velociraptor uses flat files for
  all storage. This path is where Velociraptor will write the
  files. You should mount any network filesystems or storage devices
  on this path.
* **The public DNS name of the Frontend:** The clients will connect to the
  server using this DNS name so it should be publically accessible
  (Note this is a DNS name and not a URL).
* **Google OAuth2 Client ID and Secret** are obtained from above.
* **GUI Username or email address to authorize:** The initial set of
  administrator accounts can be stored in the configuration file. When
  Velociraptor starts it will automatically add these accounts as
  administrators. When using SSO, Velociraptor does not use any
  passwords so only the user names will be recorded.
