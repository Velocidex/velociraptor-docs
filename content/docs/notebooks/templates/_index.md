summary: "Notebook artifacts are templates for creating notebooks"
---

Artifacts with the `NOTEBOOK`
[type]({{< ref "/docs/artifacts/basic_fields/#-type-" >}})
are used as templates for creating new notebooks.

While notebook templates do
have sources, these contain templates for notebook cells rather than queries.
The templates may contain VQL queries or Markdown.

## When is a notebook template "collected"?



## Export and Imports in notebook templates

Run when the notebook is created. This creation step corresponds to "collected"
in client and server artifacts.
