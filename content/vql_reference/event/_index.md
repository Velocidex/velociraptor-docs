VQL Event plugins are plugins which never terminate - but instead
generate rows based on events. Event plugins are useful for creating
client monitoring artifacts. Currently, client side monitoring
artifacts are specified in the `Events` section of the server
configuration file. When clients connect to the server, they receive a
list of monitoring artifacts they are to run. The client runs all
artifacts in parallel and their results are streamed to the server.
