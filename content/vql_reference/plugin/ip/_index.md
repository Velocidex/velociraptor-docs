### Description

Format an IP address.

Converts an ip address encoded in various ways. If the IP address is
encoded as 32 bit integer we can use netaddr4_le or netaddr4_be to
print it in a human readable way.

This currently does not support IPv6 addresses. Those are usually
encoded as an array of 8 bytes which makes it easy to format using the
`format()` function:

```
  format(format="%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x", value)
```
