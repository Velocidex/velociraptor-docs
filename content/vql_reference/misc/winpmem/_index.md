### Description

Uses the `winpmem` driver to take a memory image.

This plugin is also needed to facilitate the winpmem accessor.

When the `image_path` parameter is not set this function will load
the `winpmem` driver until the scope is destroyed at the end of
the query (where the driver will be unloaded).

If the `image_path` parameter is give, the path will be used to
create a raw memory image. The image can be compressed using a
number of algorithms such as:

1. None - no compression (default)

2. S2 or snappy - these are fast algorithms with poor compression
   ratio but should result in some speed up over no compression.

3. The Gzip method is used to produce a compatible gzip file. This
   is very slow and so it is not suitable for large memory systems
   as there will be too much smear.


### Example

```vql
SELECT winpmem(image_path='c:/test.dd', compression='s2') FROM scope()"
```
