### Description

Sets metadata about the artifact.

This VQL function is used to clean up the artifact search screen
and guide users to assist with investigations.

Velociraptor comes with a lot of built in artifacts which may be
confusing to some users and in specialized deployments it may be
preferable to guide users into a small subset of artifacts and
hide the rest.

For example, say you have a set of custom artifacts that you only
want to show. Then I would add a special keyword to their
description (for example a company name - say "Written by ACME
inc"). Then a query like this will hide the others:

```vql
SELECT name, artifact_set_metadata(name=name, hidden=TRUE)
FROM artifact_definitions() WHERE NOT description =~ "ACME"
```
