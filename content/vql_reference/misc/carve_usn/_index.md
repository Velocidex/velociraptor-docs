### Description

Carve for the USN journal entries from a device.

In practice the USN journal is set to roll over fairly quickly
(default size is usually 32Mb). On busy systems this will lead to
loss of valuable information.

This plugin carves the raw device for USN entries. Usual caveats
apply for all carved data, however this will often recover entries
from a long time before the roll over.

This plugin can take a long time!

### Example

```vql
SELECT * FROM carve_usn(device='''\\.\C:''')
```
