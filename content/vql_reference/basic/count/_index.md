### Description

Counts the items.

This function is an aggregation function that counts the number of
times it is evaluated per group by context. It is useful in a
GROUP BY clause to count the number of items in each group.

You can also use it in a regular query to produce a row
count. NOTE: When used in this way it only counts the total number
of rows that are actually evaluated (i.e. not filtered out) due to
the lazy evaluation property of VQL columns.
