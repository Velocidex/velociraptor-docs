### Description

Memoize a query into memory.

Memoizing a query means to cache the results of the query so they
can be accessed quickly.

Consider the following query:

```vql
LET ProcessDetails(ProcessPid) = SELECT Name, Pid, Ppid FROM pslist()
  WHERE Pid=ProcessPid
```

This query retrieves the process details for any Pid such as the
Name, Pid and parent Pid.

While this query works, imagine having to use it in a large query
to resolve many different processes. Each time the function is
called the pslist() plugin is run over all processes and the
correct process is selected - this can lead to thousands of
pslist() executions!

We can solve this by memoizing the results of the query -
i.e. storing them in memory and retrieving a single row based on a
key.

```vql
LET m <= memoize(query={
   SELECT str(str=Pid) AS Key, Name, Pid, Ppid FROM pslist()
}, key='Key')
```

The `memoize()` function looks like a `dict()` and when accessed
will automatically run the query once and cache its rows. The Key
column of the query is used as the key of the dict.

You can access the cache using the `get()` function or the `.`
operator. If the key matches the entire row is retrieved:

```vql
SELECT get(item=m, field=str(str=Pid)).Name AS ProcessName
FROM source()
```
