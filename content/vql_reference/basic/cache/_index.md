### Description

Creates a cache object.

A Cache is a data structure which is used to speed up calculating
data by keeping it's value in memory. A cache is essentially a key
value store - when the key is accessed, the function will be
calculated producing a value. If the key is accessed again, the
value is returned from the cache without calculating it again.

For example consider the following:

```vql
    LET get_pid_query(Lpid) =
       SELECT Pid, Ppid, Name FROM pslist(pid=Lpid)

    SELECT cache(func=get_pid_query(Lpid=Pid), key=str(str=Pid))
    FROM ....
```

The cache will ensure that get_pid_query() is only called once per
unique Pid by comparing the key against the internal memory store.
