### Description

Execute simple WMI queries synchronously.

This plugin issues a WMI query and returns its rows directly. The
exact format of the returned row depends on the WMI query issued.

This plugin creates a bridge between WMI and VQL and it is a very
commonly used plugin for inspecting the state of windows systems.
