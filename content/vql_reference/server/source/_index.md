### Description

Retrieve rows from an artifact's source.

This plugin is mostly useful in reports. It attempts to do the
right thing automatically by inferring most parameters from its
execution environment.

For example when called within a CLIENT report context, it will
automatically fill its flow id, client id etc. Typically this
means that you only need to specify the source name (for
multi-source artifacts).
