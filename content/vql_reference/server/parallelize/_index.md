### Description

Runs query on result batches in parallel.

Normally the source() plugin reads result sets from disk in
series. This is fine when the result set is not too large but when
we need to filter a lot of rows at the same time it is better to
use all cores by reading and filtering in parallel.

The `parallelize()` plugin is a parallel version of `source()`
which breaks result sets into batches and applies a query over
each batch in parallel. If you have a multi threaded machine, it
will be a lot faster.

The query passed to parallelize() will receive a special scope in
which the `source()` plugin will returns results from a small
batch of the total. The size of this batch is controlled by the
`batch` parameter.

This is especially useful when we need to filter rows from a hunt
- each client's result set will be filtered in parallel on a
different core.

### Example:

```vql
SELECT * FROM parallelize(hunt_id=HuntId, artifact=ArtifactName, query={
   SELECT * FROM source()
   WHERE FullPath =~ "XYZ"
})
```
