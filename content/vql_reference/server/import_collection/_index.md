Arg | Description | Type
----|-------------|-----
client_id|The client id to import to. Use 'auto' to generate a new client id.|string (required)
hostname|When creating a new client, set this as the hostname.|string
filename|Path on server to the collector zip.|string (required)

### Description

Imports an offline collection zip file (experimental).

Offline collectors are preconfigure Velociraptor binaries that
collect specific artifacts into a zip file.

This function allows such a collection to be imported into the GUI
as if it was collected by the server. The collection will be
loaded into a client's filestore directory.

Since there is no actual client id associated with the offline
collection (there is no Velociraptor client running on the
endpoint) we generate a random client ID for a new client.

If you specify an existing client id, the collection will be
uploaded into that client.

NOTE: Combine this function with the hunt_add() function to add a
manual offline collection to an ongoing hunt.
