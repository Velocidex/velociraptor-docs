## zip_nocase
<span class='vql_type pull-right page-header'>Accessor</span>


### Description

Open a zip file as if it was a directory.

Although zip files are case sensitive, this accessor treats file
names inside the zip file as case insensitive. This is useful when
remapping an offline collector from a Windows system for post
processing.
