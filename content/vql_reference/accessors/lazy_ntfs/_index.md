## lazy_ntfs
<span class='vql_type pull-right page-header'>Accessor</span>


### Description

Access the NTFS filesystem by parsing NTFS structures.

This accessor is a variation of the `ntfs` accessor. It is a bit
faster because it does not enumerate all the attributes in files
contained in directories, instead relying only on the `I30` index
streams. This means it is unable to find Alternate Data Streams in
directories (because ADS are not stored in the I30 stream).

Usually the extra performance is not worth these limitations since the
`ntfs` accessor is pretty fast these days already.
