{{% notice tip "Importing the artifact exchange" %}}

You can automatically import the entire content of the artifact
exchange into your server by running the
`Server.Import.ArtifactExchange` artifact.

Alternatively, download the artifact pack for [Version
0.6.9](/static/exchange/artifact_exchange_v2.zip) or for [older
versions](/static/exchange/artifact_exchange.zip), and manually upload
them in the GUI (navigate to `View Artifacts` and click the `Upload
Artifact Pack` button)
