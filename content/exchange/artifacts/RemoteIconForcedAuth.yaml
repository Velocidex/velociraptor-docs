description: |
   Attackers plant SCF, URL, and LNK files with malicious icon file paths
   on file shares to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. This attack
   only requires the user to browse to the location of the malicious file.
   This artifact enumerates file shares and returns an event for each file with a
   remote icon. It can also scan a target root directory since attackers commonly
   use other locations like desktops.
