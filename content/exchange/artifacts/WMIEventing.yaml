    This artifact collects events associated with creation and deletion of WMI 
    Event Consumers. All Event Consumers created under any namespace will 
    generate events which are filtered on event consumer classes.  
    
    It uses the ETW provider:
    Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity {1418ef04-b0b4-4623-bf7e-d74ab47bbdaa}  
    Note: This provider events have support on Windows 10+

type: CLIENT_EVENT
