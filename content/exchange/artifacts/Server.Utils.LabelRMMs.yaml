description: |
    This (server monitoring) artifact tags systems with the RMM tools present on them.
    The artifact is dependent on the artifact Windows.Detection.RMMs (found on the Artifact Exchange)
    
    After activating this monitoring artifact on the server, run the (client) artifact on systems of interest.
    
    The (server monitoring) artifact itself produces no relevant output. It should lead to the clients being tagged with the names of present RMM tools.

type: SERVER_EVENT

parameters:
   - name: LabelBasedOnNetworkIndicators
     type: bool
     default: false
