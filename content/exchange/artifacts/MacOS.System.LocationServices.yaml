   This artifact looks for applications that are registered and allowed for use of location services by checking the plist file in `/var/db/locationd/clients.plist`.  
   This can be useful to help determine if these settings have been modified by an attacker to perform location tracking.
   
   For more information about how location services could be abused, see the following:
