    It can be useful to view DHCP lease information on an endpoint.  If the  `LeaseLength`, `RouterIPAddress`, `SSID`, or other values are not as expected,  it could potentially indicate a rogue DHCP server on the network, or just misconfiguration.
    
    Either way, the information provided by this artifact can be used to help defenders find unexpected DHCP lease configuration.
