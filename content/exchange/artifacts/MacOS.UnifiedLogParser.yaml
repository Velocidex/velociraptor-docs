name: MacOS.UnifiedLogParser
description: |

  This is a simple, un-optimized artifact that leverages Mandiant's `macos-unifiedlogs`/`unifiedlog_parser` to obtain parsed log information from macOS's Unified Log.

  From the project's description:
  
  A simple Rust library that can help parse the macOS Unified Log files.

  Unified Logs were introduced in macOS version 10.12 (Sierra, 2016). Part of Apple's goal to create a unified log format for all Apple products. They exist on macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS. The Unified Logs replace many of the old log formats Apple used. This simple library can be used to parse files.
