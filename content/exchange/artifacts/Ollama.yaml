  This artifact allows enrichment using Ollama AI. 
  
  Paramaters:
  
  * `PrePrompt` - Is initial prompt default is: "You are a Cyber Incident 
  Responder and need to analyze data. You have an eye for detail and like to use 
  short precise technical language. Analyze the following data and provide 
  summary analysis:"  
  * `Prompt` - Is secondary prompt, good practice is add some strings related to 
  the type of data for analysis or artifact name to provide context.
  * `PromptData` - add object to be serialized and added to the prompt.
  * `Model` - Model to use for your request.
  * `TargetUri` - Ollama target URI
  * `MaxPromptSize` - If set will cut the final prompt to this size in bytes to 
  assist maintaining context limits
  
  This artifact can be called from within another artifact (such as one looking 
  for files) to enrich the data made available by that artifact.
