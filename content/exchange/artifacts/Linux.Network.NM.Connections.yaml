  NetworkManager is a popular high-level interface for configuring
  networks in Linux systems, in particular Ubuntu and other Debian-based
  flavours. This artifact lists the NetworkManager state, all configured
  connections and their settings, as well as when the connections were
  last activated. A list of BSSIDs per connection is also retrieved.

  All the information is retrieved from NetworkManager configuration
  files and other state files. Connection information is stored in
  the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections as long as the "keyfile"
  plugin is selected in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (this
  is the default). Note that by default, NetworkManager doesn't managed
  connections defined in /etc/network/interfaces.

  Whether the connections are currently active is not stored in file
  and must be queried using using nmcli or through dbus. If the parameter
  QueryActive is true (default false), nmcli will be run as an external
  program to retrieve this information.

  Information such as IP addresses, routes, DNS servers and other settings
  can also be collected from all managed interfaces using nmcli. Set
  QueryDevices to true to collect this.

  This artifact also exports two functions, parse_ini(filename) and
  parse_ini_as_dict(filename), which may be useful to parse INI files
  in other artifacts.
