name: Server.Utils.OrphanedFlows
description: |
  Sometimes flows are deleted but there is still outstanding data for
  them in flight. The server will continue to save this data after the
  flow is deleted.

  This happens when a hunt is deleted (thereby deleting all its flows)
  but there are in flight collections still outstanding.
