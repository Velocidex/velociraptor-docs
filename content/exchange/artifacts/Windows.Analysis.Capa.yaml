   Analyze PE, ELF, or shellcode files with capa.

   "capa detects capabilities in executable files. You run it against
   a PE, ELF, or shellcode file and it tells you what it thinks the
   program can do. For example, it might suggest that the file is a
   backdoor, is capable of installing services, or relies on HTTP to
   communicate."
