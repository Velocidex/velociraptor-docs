    * Execute Eric Zimmerman's JLECmd to parse AUTOMATICDESTINATIONS-MS and CUSTOMDESTINATIONS-MS files in C:\ drive recursively and return output for analysis. (jlecmd.exe -d C:/ --csvf -csv tmpdir results.csv).
    * JLECmd.zip is downloaded from the URL to 'C:\Program Files\Velociraptor\Tools' folder.
    * JLECmd.zip can be uploaded to Velociraptor Server in order to copy it to the clients in case there is no internet connection.
    * Created using @carlos_cajigas LECmd VQL as a quide.
    * JLECmd is a CLI tool for analyzing Custom Destinations jump list data. Learn more - https://github.com/EricZimmerman/JLECmd
