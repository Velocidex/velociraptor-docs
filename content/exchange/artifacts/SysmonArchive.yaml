description: |
   If configured, Sysmon EID 23: FileDelete enables archiving file deletes on 
   disk. The challenges of this configuration is management of the archive 
   folder which can grow to be significant size and use up disk space.  
   
   This artifact enables management of the archive, listing files and removing 
   old files over a configured maximum.
   
   For monitoring: Use in combination with Windows.Events.SysmonArchive
