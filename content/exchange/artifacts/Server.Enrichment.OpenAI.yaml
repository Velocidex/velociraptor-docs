  Query OpenAI for analysis of data.
  
  Paramaters:
  
  * `PrePrompt` - Is System prompt default is: "You are a Cyber Incident 
  Responder and need to analyze data. You have an eye for detail and like to use 
  short precise technical language. Analyze the following data and provide 
  summary analysis:"  
  * `Prompt` - Is User prompt as string. When pushing a dict object via PromtData 
  good practice is add some strings related to the type of data for analysis or 
  artifact name to provide context.
  * `PromptData` - add optional object to be serialized and added to the User prompt.
  * `Model` - Model to use for your request.
  * `MaxPromptSize` - If set will cut the final prompt to this size in bytes to 
  assist maintaining context limits
  
  This artifact can be called from within another artifact (such as one looking 
  for files) to enrich the data made available by that artifact.
  
type: SERVER

parameters:
    - name: PrePrompt
      type: string
      description: |
        A prefix to be used with the prompt. For example, when asking 
        a question, then providing data separately

        You are a Cyber Incident responder and need to analyse forensic 
        collections. You have an eye for detail and like to use short precise 
        technical language. Your PRIMARY goal is to analyse the following data 
        and provide summary analysis -
    - name: Prompt
      type: string
      description: The data sent to OpenAI
      default: "what is prefetch?"
    - name: PromptData
      type: string
      description: The data sent to OpenAI - this data is serialised and added to the prompt
    - name: Model
      type: string
      description: The model used for processing the prompt
      default: gpt-4o
    - name: OpenAIToken
      type: string
      description: Token for OpenAI. Leave blank here if using server metadata store.
    - name: MaxPromptSize
      type: int
      description: Will limit your prompt to this size in bytes. Helps maintain context sizes.
