   This artifact watches for completion of the `watchArtifact`
   and assigns the given `setLabel` if the `WHERE` condition is matched.
   
   Anytime the `Windows.System.Services` hunt is run across the environment,
   results will be interpreted by this server-side artifact.
   
   In this configuration, it will match on all systems running 
   "Active Directory Domain Services" which likely indicates the system
   is a Domain Controller and will label it as such.
