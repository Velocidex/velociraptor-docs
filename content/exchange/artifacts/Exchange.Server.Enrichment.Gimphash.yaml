    Calculate the Gimphash for a Golang binary.
    
    See: https://github.com/NextronSystems/gimphash
    
    This artifact can be called from within another artifact (such as one looking for Golang binaries) to enrich the data made available by that artifact.
  
    Ex.
  
    `SELECT * from Artifact.Server.Enrichment.Gimphash(File=$YOURFILE)`
    
    NOTE: You will need to change the tool URL if using Linux as your server OS.
