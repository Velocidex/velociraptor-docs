name: Generic.Events.TrackNetworkConnections
author: Herbert BÃ¤rschneider @SEC Consult
description: |
   This artifact is meant for monitoring network connections on clients.
   It periodically queries the existing network connections and emits lines for differences (new connections and missing/removed ones).
   Network connections are tracked and compared based on following elements: process id, layer 3 protocol, layer 4 protocol, local address used, local port used, remote address used, remote port used.
   
   The network connection information is enriched with process information to make it easier to analyze emited lines.

type: CLIENT_EVENT

parameters:
   - name: Period
     default: 2
