    Inspects extended file capabilities with getcap.  
    Since Linux 2.6.24, setcap can attach fine-grained privilege bits to 
    executables, letting them perform the specific privileged actions they 
    require instead of running as root.   
    If a binary thatâ€™s writable or executable by non-privileged users is granted 
    excessive capabilities, attackers can exploit it for privilege escalation.
