   This artifact uses glob to remove a file or folder.  
   To recursively target a folder: ```C:\folder\path{,\**}```  
   To target multiple folders: ```C:\{folder2\path2{,\**},folder\path{,\**}}``` 
   however advised to just run 2 collections...   
     
    WARNING: There has been a bug in older versions of Velociraptor that ```\**```
    glob path will select all files. PLEASE SCOPE FIRST and use appropriate targeting.
