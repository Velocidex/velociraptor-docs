    This artifact leverages Chainsaw to enable usage of Sigma rules (in addition to built-in rules) to faciliate detection within Windows Event Logs.
    
    From the project's description:
    
    "Chainsaw provides a powerful ‘first-response’ capability to quickly identify threats within Windows event logs. 
    It offers a generic and fast method of searching through event logs for keywords, and by identifying threats using built-in detection logic and via support for Sigma detection rules."
