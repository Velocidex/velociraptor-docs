name: Server.Enrichment.EchoTrail
author: Eric Capuano - @eric_capuano

  This is a process execution enrichment artifact that can be called from within another artifact (such as one looking at running processes) to enrich the 
  data made available by that artifact. We are calling the EchoTrail v2 API which is still in beta. 
  
  NOTE: The EchoTrail free API is limited to 25 queries per day which is very low for most use cases. This artifact may send more than 25 queries at the API!

  Ex.

    `SELECT * from Artifact.Server.Enrichment.EchoTrail(lookup_image='C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe', lookup_parent_image='C:\Windows\explorer.exe')`

  Additional lookup parameters that can be passed:

    - `lookup_hostname`: The hostname which the execution occurred on (for host-specific prevelance metrics)
    - `lookup_image_hash`: The SHA256 hash of the process image 
    - `lookup_parent_image_hash`: The SHA256 hash of the process parent image
    - `lookup_commandline`: Command line arguments of the process

type: SERVER

    - name: EchoTrailKey
