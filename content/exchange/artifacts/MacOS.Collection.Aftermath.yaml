    This is a simple artifact that leverages Afermath to collect many
    different forensic artifacts from a macOS host, then uploads the results to
    the Velociraptor server.

    From the project's description:

    Aftermath is a Swift-based, open-source incident response framework.

    Aftermath can be leveraged by defenders in order to collect and subsequently analyze the data from the compromised host. Aftermath can be deployed from an MDM (ideally), but it can also run independently from the infected user's command line.

    This artifact currently supports the `--deep` scan option, which will produce an initial archive file. Additional support for on-host analysis may be added later.
