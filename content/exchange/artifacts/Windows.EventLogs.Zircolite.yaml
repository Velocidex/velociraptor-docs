    Zircolite is a standalone tool that can be used to apply Sigma rules to EVTX files on endpoints in an effort to quickly parse large datasets and surface detections.
                
    You can read more about Zircolite below:
        
    https://github.com/wagga40/Zircolite
        
    This artifact currently supports usage of the built-in rulesets. Support for custom ruleset usage will be added in the future. 
        
    NOTE: This artifact may take several minutes to run, depending on the size of EVTX files being analyzed.
