   This artifact enables collection of TeamViewer log entries for keyboard layout 
   changes.  
   
   The artifact firstly searches for TeamViewer log filenames, then applies yara 
   to extract log lines. The artifact by default hunts for Chinese, Vietnamese 
   and Russian language changes as priority, then uses a catch all for generic 
   changes. You can add additional targeted yara as desired to sort output.  
   
   In each log entry there are two language codes, the first being keyboard 
   layout of the connecting system and the second one the default input profile 
   of the target host. The same language codes could indicate legitimate support.
   
   Lookup Language codes at the Microsoft link for references. Examples below:  
   
   0409 - US English  
   0419 - Russian  
   0804 - Chinese Simplified  
   0404 - Chinese Traditional  
   042a - Vietnamese
