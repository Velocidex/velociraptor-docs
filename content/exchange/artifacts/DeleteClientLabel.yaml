name: Server.Utils.DeleteClientLabel
author: Matt Green - @mgreen27
description: |
  This artifact completely removes a client from the data store if a configured
  label is set.

  We reccomend running as a server artifact then if happy with actions add as an
  action for monitoring.

  Be careful with this one: there is no way to recover old
  data. However, if the client still exists, it will just
  automatically re-enroll when it next connects. You will still be able
  to talk to it, it is just that old collected data is deleted.

type: SERVER

parameters:
  - name: LabelToDelete
    description: A label to delete the client if applied to machine.
    default: todelete
  - name: ReallyDoIt
    description: If you really want to delete the client, check this.
