   This artifact extracts useful data for triage of ConnectWise ScreenConnect
   CVE-2024-1709 and CVE-2024-1708 impacting versions 23.9.7 and prior.
   
   This artifact will:   
   
   1. Check for Webshells in ```/App_Extensions/**/*.{aspx,ashx}``` path.  
   Some observed legitimate webapp strings have been excluded.   
   NOTE: Use WebshellsUSN to find potential exploits that cleanup shells.   
   
   2. Parse ```C:\Program Files\ScreenConnect\App_data\User.Xml``` file.   
   Usually this file is set during first use and reset during exploit. 
   Check for timestamp discrepancies and obviously evil usernames/email 
   (@poc.com).  
   
   3. Parse ```security.db```.   
   Add time filter. Results are stacked, check for unusual access patterns 
   and malicious IPs.
   
   4. List and upload (optionally) all ScreenConnect files.
   
   Collect additional artifacts as desired for support.
