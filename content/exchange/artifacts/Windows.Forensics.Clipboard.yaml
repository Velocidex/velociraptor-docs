    This artifact will show the Clipboard activity.
    
    The artefact ActivitiesCache.db has started to log clipboard activity since Windows 10 version 1803.
    
    The prerequisite for clipboard data to be logged by this artefact relies on the system having two settings checked:
        Clipboard history enabled 
        Clipboard sync across devices 

    StartTime (epoch time) – When the data was first copied to the clipboard 

    ExpirationTime (epoch time) – When the data will be deleted from the ActivitiesCache.db (roughly 12 hours) 

    ClipboardPayload – Base64 encoded string of the clipboard contents, but here it is decoded, and the clipboard content is shown  

    Payload – This field tells you where the clipboard data was copied from! 

    ActivityType – Type 10 means data resides in clipboard, Type 16 shows if data was copied or pasted
