  This artifact collects detailed file metadata from Linux directories specified by the TargetDirectories parameter. The default directories include /tmp, /home, /etc, /var, /usr, /boot, /opt, /lib, and /root, but users can modify this list as needed.
  Metadata such as file size, modification time, access time, creation time, and file type (directory or symbolic link) is gathered recursively up to a depth defined by the MaxRecursionDepth parameter.
  For symbolic links, the artifact also captures the target path that the symlink points to.
