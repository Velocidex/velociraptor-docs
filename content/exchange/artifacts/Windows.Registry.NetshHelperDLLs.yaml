    # Enumerate all NetSh Helper DLLs

    Inspired by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/SecurePeacock/status/1532011932315680769?s=20&t=IFbej-qpkF6IB7ycewE31w),
    this artifact enumerates all NetSh Helper DLLs to provide
    opportunities to find outliers and potential persistence mechanisms 
    tied to [netsh.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Netsh/)

    I have run this hunt across 6K+ systems and identified the most common entries and provided
    the `excludeCommon` option to exclude these. In very large environments there will likely still be FPs, 
    but they should be far and few.
