# Pre-populating a server with clients, hunts and flows

When setting up a Velociraptor server for training or demonstration,
it is sometimes desirable to have some data already populated.

For a realistic training exercise, some people use a [Cyber
Range](https://github.com/iknowjason/BlueCloud) to fully emulate a
real environment. However, managing a large Cyber Range is complex and
expensive.

Sometimes, we just want a simple Velociraptor server with
pre-populated data, so users can learn how to analyze hunt results,
and improve their VQL skills!

## In Velociraptor - Everything is a file!

The Velociraptor server simply keeps all the data as simple files on
disk.  These files are organized into higher level concepts like
Clients, Flows, Hunts and notebooks.

Conceptually you can think of these as just storage hierarchies which
can be easily recreated:

1. A `Flow` is a single collection that occurred as a particular
   time. Flows **Contain** artifact results, and uploaded files.

2. A `Client` represents an endpoint. The Velociraptor server stores
   all flows under the client's directory in the file store. Clients
   have a unique client id which is how we can identify them.

3. A `Hunt` is a logical set of clients and flows which can be
   processed together using plugins like `hunt_results()` or
   `source()`

## Creating clients.

Normally a client will be created on the server when a physical client
first connects to it. However, it is possible to create new "client"
objects using the VQL [client_create()](https://docs.velociraptor.app/vql_reference/server/client_create/) function.

Let's create 100 clients:

```vql
SELECT client_create(os="windows",
   hostname=format(format="Host%d", args=_value)) AS ClientId
FROM range(end=100)
```

## Adding flows to the clients.

Normally, we would schedule a collection on clients to gather real
data from the endpoint. But this is not essential, we can also
`import` an existing collection into the client's storage space.

The existing collection can be taken on any Velociraptor instance - it
is just a zip file export of a collection.

For this article, I will collect the `Generic.Client.Info` artifact
and export the collection into a ZIP file in the collection overview
page.

Next we import the collection into each client on the server:

```vql
SELECT import_collection(client_id=client_id,
    filename="/tmp/Generic.Info.zip")
FROM clients()
```

## Assign collections to a hunt

A Hunt is a managed container of collections. Normally we schedule a
hunt so the Velociraptor server can automatically schedule flows on
clients that match the hunt criteria, and keep track of these in a
central location.

However, we can also just add arbitrary flows to a hunt using VQL. In
this example I will add all the `Generic.Client.Info` collections we
imported previously into a new hunt so I can analyze them together.

First I create a hunt using the GUI to collect the
`Generic.Cl ient.Info` artifact, but I will leave the hunt in the
`STOPPED` state.

![Creating an empty hunt](example_hunt.png)

The hunt currently has no clients or flows associated with it.

I can now assign the latest `Generic.Client.Info` collection from each
client:

```
LET HuntId <= "H.D35CUR4S00IHC"

SELECT client_id,
       session_id,
       HuntId,
       hunt_add(client_id=client_id, hunt_id=HuntId, flow_id=session_id)
FROM foreach(row={
    SELECT * FROM clients()
}, query={
    SELECT *
    FROM flows(client_id=client_id)
    WHERE artifacts_with_results =~ "Generic.Client.Info"
    LIMIT 1
})
```

The above query:

1. Iterates over all clients
2. For each client, iterates over all flows in that client
3. Select the first flow with artifact results of `Generic.Client.Info`
4. After one flow matches for each client, go to the next client (this is the `LIMIT` clause).
5. Add the flow to the hunt we created earlier.


## Post process the collections

Depending on the scenarios you want to demonstrate, you can create
different clients (perhaps a "Compromised" set) and import different
collections into them.

This method allows running any post processing steps in notebooks as
if these client are real endpoints.
