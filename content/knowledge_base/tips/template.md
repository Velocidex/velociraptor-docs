# This is the title of the article

It should be in the form of a question or task - for example: `How do
I search for malicious downloaded files?` (The website will use the
first heading as the searchable title.)

The first paragraph after the title should be a short description of
the kb article. It will be searchable on the main knowledge base page.

The rest of the article is normal markdown. You can also include
screenshots.

need for users who may not be familiar with Velociraptor or DFIR in
general. It should have pointers for further research or links to
other knowledge base articles.

Once you finish writing the article, simply save it to a local branch
and send a pull request.

You can tag your tip using the following syntax. A line starting with
