# How do I re-collect a failed artifact in a hunt?

Sometimes collecting an artifact in a hunt does not work as
expected.

Most commonly the issue is that the timeout or upload limit
for collecting the artifact is exceeded and Velociraptor cancels the
collection to prevent placing the endpoint under too much strain.

How do we work around this? We can recollect the artifact only on that
failed endpoint with a few button clicks.

In the following example I will start a collection for the `$MFT` but
I will only set the timeout to 10 seconds and `100Mb` uploaded.

In the hunt resources screen I can specify limits for collection from
any one client. These limits are intended to set reasonable boundaries
for how much data I am expecting to collect so we do not overload the
network or the endpoint itself.

![Setting resource limits](setting_resources.png)

Clearly these limits are too small for this client because the
collection was cancelled after 10 seconds. Normally the default
timeout of 10 Minutes, but collecting such a lot of data may take
longer than that.

![Collection timed out](timed_out.png)

Although some data was transferred, not all the data was fully
collected. This might be acceptable but if this machine is really
compromised how can I recollect the same artifact?

By inspecting the collections for each client in the `Clients` tab, I
can quickly see which one failed.

Since a hunt is just a grouping of regular collections, I can navigate
to the client in the interface (by clicking the client button) and
find the hunt's collection that failed.

![Copying the collection](copy_collection.png)

Now I just copy the collection as normal and here I can update the
resource limits if needed (or maybe change some of the parameters).

![Successful Collection](successful_collection.png)

Now that this collection is completed I can just look at the results
of the collections by itself or download the collection files for
further analysis.

However, it is much more useful to keep all related collections in the
same hunt. This helps when analyzing the hunt results in the notebook
or exporting all the related files at once.

{{% notice tip "Hunts are a set of collections" %}}

It is best to think of a `hunt` as just a set of related artifact
collections. You can add/remove collections from this set at will.

{{% /notice %}}

I am add the new collection to the hunt manually by clicking the `Add
to Hunt` button.

![Manually Adding the collection to the hunt](manually_adding_hunt_collection.png)

The interface shows me all hunts that collected the same artifact so I
choose which hunt to add it to.

![The new collection is now part of the hunt](new_hunt_collection.png)


Now the new successful collection is part of the hunt. I can see it as
a second entry in the client's list.

{{% notice note "Deleting the old collection" %}}

Velociraptor does not automatically delete the old failed collection
because it may still have some useful data (some data **was**
transferred).

If you do not want the old data any more, then just click the `Delete
Flow` button once a better collection is available.

## Using VQL

The above discussion was how to manually redo collections in the GUI
but if there are many collections, it might be easier to use VQL to do
this.

```vql
LET NewCollections = SELECT ClientId, FlowId,
    collect_client(client_id=ClientId,
        artifacts=Flow.request.artifacts,
        spec=Flow.request.specs,
        max_bytes=1000000000,
        timeout=600) AS NewCollection
FROM hunt_flows(hunt_id=HuntId)
WHERE Flow.state =~ "ERROR"

SELECT ClientId, NewCollection, hunt_add(
   client_id=ClientId,
   hunt_id=HuntId,
   flow_id=NewCollection.flow_id) AS Hunt
FROM NewCollections
```

1. The `NewCollections` query gets all Flows in the `ERROR` state
   within a hunt and schedules a new collection using the same
   artifacts but increasing the maximum upload size to 1gb and timeout
   to 600 seconds.

2. The next query adds the new collection to the hunt.

Note this query will only work after [#2067](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/commit/768021225bd617bb279fe424dcdf29c6d7d467b4)
