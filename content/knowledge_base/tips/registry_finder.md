title: How do I search for registry keys?
---

To search the registry simply use the "registry" accessor with the `Windows.Search.FileFinder` artifact.

This works because Velociraptor can glob the registry as if it were a filesystem (See [Filesystem Accessors]({{% ref "/docs/forensic/filesystem/#filesystem-accessors" %}})
