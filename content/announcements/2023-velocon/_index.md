## Detailed Program

### Content Management Like a Boss!
By **Matt Green** - Principal Software Engineer, Velociraptor/Rapid7

Content management is one of the most under rated Velociraptor capabilities 
used by mature users. This talk will walk through some basics of content 
management, introduce automation and hopefully leave you with actionable 
ideas on how to do Velociraptor Content like a boss. 

### Fast DFIR with Velociraptor
By **Mike Cohen** - Digital Paleontologist

You have probably already heard of Velociraptor - the leading open
source DFIR platform! Velociraptor provides unprecedented deep
visibility into the endpoint with an impressive number of built in and
community contributed analysis modules - all available for free under
an open source license!  However, with all the capabilities that
Velociraptor comes with, it can be a little confusing to know exactly
which artifact to collect when responding to any one situation. This
can be even harder when the clock is ticking… while containing an
incident!


This is when a real world, practical walk through can be most
valuable! In this webcast, Mike Cohen, the lead developer of
Velociraptor will work through a typical DFIR investigation: Detecting
and containing an attacker who gains a foothold on a network. We will
examine techniques for hunting at scale for the attacker to identify
their foothold and reconstruct the event timeline. We then detect
attacker persistence to prevent re-infection.

There is something to learn for everyone: If you currently use
Velociraptor in your daily workflow you might learn some additional
artifacts you might be able to leverage. If you currently do not use
Velociraptor, this webinar will provide a demonstration of some of the
powerful capabilities that come bundled in this widely popular DFIR
tool!

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, SOC analysts are
constantly challenged to detect, respond to, and remediate security
incidents swiftly and efficiently. This presentation focuses on
designing automation playbooks while using Velociraptor’s features
that enable SOC analysts to enhance their capabilities: The
presentation begins by highlighting the significance of live response
in incident handling and investigations. We delve into the limitations
of traditional approaches and showcase how Velociraptor revolutionizes
the live response landscape. Through its open-source nature,
extensibility, and powerful query language, Velociraptor empowers SOC
analysts to perform real-time investigations and gather valuable
forensic data across endpoints, networks.  Additionally, the
presentation highlights the capabilities of the Velociraptor app
within the SOAR platform. We showcase how the Velociraptor app,
leveraging its API integration.This integration empowers SOC analysts
to leverage Velociraptor's powerful live response capabilities
directly within the IMPERUM platform, enhancing efficiency and
centralizing incident response efforts.With the integration of
Velociraptor and IMPERUM, SOC analysts can streamline incident
response workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and orchestrate complex
security operations seamlessly.  The presentation then underscores the
benefits of Velociraptor and live response automation. We emphasize
how these technologies improve the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of
incident response. By enabling SOC analysts to gather forensically
sound evidence, perform deep-dive investigations, and make data-driven
decisions, Velociraptor becomes a force multiplier in the SOC
ecosystem. Moreover, the integration of Velociraptor with IMPERUM
augments the effectiveness of incident response by enabling proactive
threat hunting, correlation of events, and automated remediation
actions.  Lastly, we discuss real-world use cases and success stories
that demonstrate the tangible impact of Velociraptor in live response
scenarios. Through these examples, we illustrate how SOC analysts can
effectively handle and mitigate security incidents, significantly
reducing the mean time to detect and respond and minimizing the
overall impact of cyber threats.  In conclusion, this presentation
highlights the transformative potential of Velociraptor and IMPERUM in
empowering SOC analysts. By combining the live response capabilities
of Velociraptor with playbooks, organizations can enhance their
incident response capabilities, strengthen their security posture, and

### Windows Search Index: The forensic artifact you’ve been searching for

By **Phalgun Kulkarni** - DFIR Consultant - Aon
And **Julia Paluch** DFIR Software Developer - Aon


For examiners investigating cyber-crimes on Windows endpoints, the
Windows Search Index consists of rich information such as a user's
Internet history, emails, file interactions, and even deleted
data. Created as a tool to enable searching for files across the
Windows operating system, the Windows Search Index as a forensic
artifact provides insight into file existence and user activity. In
this presentation, we will discuss how the Windows Search Index can be
used as a source of evidence in DFIR investigations and how it can be
parsed at scale by integrating an open-source tool named SIDR (Search
Index Database Reporter) with Velociraptor.

This presentation will provide an overview of the data recorded in the
Windows Search Index by default and user actions that trigger
modifications of the index. Next, we will introduce the structure of
the index in Windows 10 and prior operating systems, and how it has
changed in Windows 11. We will also discuss use cases for the
information present in the index, such as finding evidence of website
access, deleted data, and activity from users of interest. Finally, we
will introduce SIDR (Search Index Database Reporter) and a
Velociraptor plugin, to parse the Windows Search Index at scale.

Attendees will gain a deep understanding of the Windows Search Index
structure, how it can be used as a forensic artifact, and the insights
it can provide to bolster the next investigation.

### Velociraptor As a Learning Tool

By: **Andreas van Leeuwen Flamino** -  Cyber Intelligence Center Team Lead, Flamino IR

The objective of this talk will be to persuade the audience to use
Velociraptor as a learning and teaching tool. The talk takes many cues
from my personal experience with Velociraptor. I have used it as a key
tool in the DFIR function at a mega event, and in high-profile
incident response engagements when I worked in an IR service delivery
team. I will cover how Velociraptor can be used as a learning and
teaching tool.

Part 1 - As a learning tool In this part of the presentation I will
expand how it helped me, someone who has a decent foundation and
experience with operating systems, become a better threat hunter,
incident responder and forensic analyst. I will cover how it helped
me:
- Become a better threat hunter, because the operator has to be
explicit when asking the tool questions. Really thinking through what
you are looking for sharpens the mind.
- Understand the limitations of commercial tooling;
- I will cover some advantages over typical EDRs, because Velociraptor
allows you to ask such diverse and specific questions.
- I will cover the advantages over forensic tooling, touching on the
speed and scale with which you can perform investigations, if forensic
soundness is not a hard requirement.
- Remove abstraction layers. Becoming more tool agnostic, and less
limited by commercial tooling feature sets.
- Understand the limitations of your own knowledge. Spotting gaps in
one’s own knowledge and understanding. For example, different hashes of
certain DLLs in an environment where all endpoints are created from the
same Golden Image with the same level of patching, can make one curious
why these DLLs are different. I will add more examples.
- Deepen practical understanding of the arts and science of digital
forensics and incident response. I can cover how I feel that delivering rapid
Incident Response engagements is an art, where creativity is a must, on top of
a solid foundation of the science of Operating Systems and computing
principles. Velociraptor allows the responder to get to work quickly, creatively
(by virtue of the wide variety of pivots it allows for) and intentionally.
- Lean how certain functionality is exposed to user land in Windows. By
virtue of having source code for artifacts.
- Understand how widespread vulnerabilities are, or how certain
exploits work. One example that comes to mind are the several Log4J artifacts
that were released around the time of that vulnerability being (re)discovered
and exploited en masse. Understanding how these artifacts are implemented
can greatly deepen the operator insight.
- Stand on the shoulders of great researchers. Explaining we don’t need to
know the fine details to get started. This is a nod back to a comment Mike
made in one of the Enterprise Hunting and Incident Response course videos.
- Understand how vulnerable a lot of software is, including software
from vendors that should know better. Unquoted service definitions for AV
agents, for example. I will add more examples.

Part 2 - As a teaching tool
In the second part I will cover how it helped make associate analysts
rapidly increase their exposure and experience. I will explain how I feel that
Velociraptor has some parallels to UNIX and Linux shell commands, in the
sense that it offers many core artifacts that can do one thing really well. If
the practitioner learns how each of these core artifacts works, and then
learns how to combine them, they can start to answer complex questions
quickly. Because this process is fluid (you can combine and dig deeper in
whatever interests you), it truly develops the qualities of being self-starting
and resourceful. I believe these two skills are foundational in many areas of
life.

The main thought I will expand on in the second part is how
Velociraptor can help interested junior associates become more senior
associates in a shorter amount of time. Some examples I will share are:
- Analyzing results of hunts on a regular basis, first perhaps only in Excel,
and later leveraging basic, and later more creative VQL statements.
- Digging deeper on endpoints to qualify alerts from other tools on an
ongoing basis to establish a much more thorough baseline.
- Being able to quickly pivot. For example, from looking at a potentially
malicious execution in UserAssist, to pulling MFT for a specific time window
to increase context. Or pulling authentication logs for that same time window
to see if there are any anomalies. All while not leaving the Velociraptor
interface.
- Removing dependency on the typical SOC chain of: typical commercial
endpoint tooling being installed and running > availability, and proper
definition of (custom) detection rules > event collectors, and all their possible
issues > SIEM > use-cases and their potential gaps > SOAR technologies that
are created with right intentions, but can also lead to tunnel vision, etc. Then
contrasting this to having one tool where you can ask questions across all
enrolled hosts and just dig into the result set yourself.
- Being closer to the OS because you are directly interacting with it.
- Reducing reliance on vendors and their support teams. I will add some
great examples of the power of the Velociraptor community, where
practitioners of diverse backgrounds and experience levels can easily find
each other and get answers. Contrasting this to using the support contract of
large commercial vendors where you often have to wait several days to get a
response that doesn’t go beyond what you can already read in the available
documentation yourself.
- Reducing reliance on automation and other people’s opinions and
enrichment. I will explain how enrichment isn’t bad, but that it’s great to not
only rely on third party enrichment to start.
- I will reiterate that when you combine all the above, you becoming more
resourceful and self-starting as a result.

### Tracing the Footsteps: A Bird's Eye View of Lateral Movement Using Velociraptor

By: **Phalgun Kulkarni** - DFIR Consultant
And **Kostya Ilioukevitch** - DFIR Sr. Consultant, Aon

One of the commonly asked questions by stakeholders and major goals
during an incident response investigation is to identify the systems
accessed by the threat actor; in short, identification of “Lateral
Movement.” Recently, our team has developed a new Velociraptor plugin
that goes deeper into a broader set of lateral movement artifacts to
provide examiners with more opportunities to detect threat actor
movement during investigations.

Typically, forensic examiners rely on Windows Event Logs to identify
lateral movement. While Windows Event Logs are a great source to
identify such activity, there may be a chance that the events may have
rolled over or certain event IDs are not enabled. Other artifacts such
as Windows UAL, Shellbags, Windows Registry, application configuration
files etc. can be utilized in addition to Windows Event Logs to
provide a more holistic overview into lateral movement activity within
a network.

This presentation focuses on: Introducing a brand-new Velociraptor
plugin that provides a holistic view of lateral movement across the
network.  A process to efficiently visualize lateral movement across
multiple systems.


This talk briefly discusses various Windows OS artifacts, including
the artifacts generated by remote access tools like WinSCP, that can
be analyzed using Velociraptor to identify lateral movement. We
categorize the artifacts into inbound (destination system artifacts)
and outbound (source system artifacts) access, making it easier to
identify the type of access. Additionally, we introduce a new Windows
lateral movement Velociraptor plugin that provides a better,
data-rich, and contextual view of lateral movement. This plugin builds
on the existing `Windows.Packs.LateralMovement` hunt by adding more data
such as the time, source host, destination host, and application while
supporting a more diverse set of artifacts such as Windows UAL,
Shellbags, Windows Registry ,and application configuration
files. Finally, we will also cover how to efficiently consume the
output generated by this plugin through tools that support data
visualizations.

Future implementations:

The current implementation of this plugin includes artifacts from
Windows systems. It can be further enhanced by including lateral
movement artifacts from Linux environments.

Attendees will gain:

Knowledge about various lateral movement artifacts present on Windows
OS (including Remote Access Tools artifacts), which can be utilized to
identify the affected systems and Threat Actor’s movement in a
network.  The ability to efficiently consume the data generated by our
Velociraptor plugin through data visualizations.
