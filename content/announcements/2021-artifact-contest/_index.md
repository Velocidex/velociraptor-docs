## The Contest is now closed!

Check out the [submissions]({{< ref "/blog/2021/2021-10-08-contributor-contest/" >}}) and watch the winning presentation at the [SANS Threat Hunting Summit](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-events/threat-hunting-and-incident-response-summit-2021/#agenda)

## Goals

This competition encourages development of useful content and
extension to the Velociraptor platform. Content may be VQL (server or
client), plugin, integration, workflow or other capabilities.

Some specific ideas:

1. **Impactful process/integration** - How does your contribution help in
   making real world DFIR work smoother and more efficient? Describe
   how you used to do this task previously and how it has been
   improved as a result of your contribution.

2. **Detection artifacts** - Each submission may contain several VQL
   artifacts - how do the artifacts improve Velociraptor’s detection
   capability? Can you include metrics of how effective they are
   compared to previous technology?

3. **Monitoring artifacts/plugins** - This category includes real time
   monitoring queries to enhance Velociraptor’s endpoint monitoring
   capability.

## Deadline

Deadline for submission is Midnight 20th September 2021 anywhere on earth. The email address for submission is: **contest@velociraptor.app**

## Winner Announcements

Winners will be announced at the [SANS Threat Hunting Summit Thurs Oct 7 - Fri, Oct 8, 2021](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-events/threat-hunting-and-incident-response-summit-2021)

## Prizes

The competition carries 3 prize levels, first prize is **$5000 USD**, Second
prize **$3000 USD** and third prize at **$2000 USD**. All winners will also
receive a Velociraptor contributor coin, commemorating them as a
valued member of the Velociraptor community.

Winning submissions will also be published on the Velociraptor web
site.

Significant contributions will receive some cool Velociraptor
merchendise.

## Requirements

The submitted content should work with the latest Velociraptor
release. If your content requires new functionality, work with us to
implement it in time for the submission deadline.

A submission must include new functionality in the form of VQL
artifacts, Velociraptor plugins or new Velociraptor
code/integration. Submissions should also include a short document or
video explaining the contribution and its value to the wider DFIR
community.


## Non-eligibility

The Rapid 7 Velociraptor team can not submit but will be available to
consult and assist other entrants. You may draw on any member of the
community for help in creating the contribution (e.g. ask for help on
Discord, file GitHub issues or feature requests etc), but all
contributions should be substantially your own.

We have a lot of industry leaders on the judging panel. Members of the
judging panel may enter a submission but they may not vote on their
own submission or any submission for which they declare a conflict of
interest.

## Submission Process

The submission should include the code, description and a write up of
functionality, background and a signed contribution license agreement
([CLA](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/CLA.md)).

In particular we want to know how the submission improves a capability
or workflow in the real world. We value practical and impactful
changes over technologically complex, but rarely used additions. The
submission writeup should be sufficiently detailed for the judging
panel to properly assess the novelty and usefulness of the submission.

All submission code will be released under the same license as
Velociraptor (i.e. [AGPL](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/LICENSE)) and may be included in future
releases. Contributors should also sign the Velociraptor CLA prior to
submitting a contribution (Please click [here to sign](https://cla-assistant.io/Velocidex/velociraptor) and indicate your Github username in the submission).

## Selection criteria

The Velociraptor competition judges are selected from the wider
industry and past community contributions. The judges will
independently rank contributions and will vote based on the following
broad criteria.

* Usefulness
* Creativity
* Effort / Difficulty
* Completeness of solution
* Clarity of documentation

Selected works may also be asked to present their work at future
conferences with the Velociraptor team and featured on the
Velociraptor blog.
