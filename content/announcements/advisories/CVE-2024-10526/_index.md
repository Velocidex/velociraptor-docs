title: "CVE-2024-10526 Local Privilege Escalation In Windows Velociraptor Service"
description: |
    The Velociraptor Windows MSI installer creates the installation directory with WRITE_DACL permission to the BUILTIN\\Users group. This allows local users who are not administrators to grant themselves the Full Control permission on Velociraptor's files. By modifying Velociraptor's files, local users can subvert the binary and cause the Velociraptor service to execute arbitrary code as the SYSTEM user, or to replace the Velociraptor binary completely.
