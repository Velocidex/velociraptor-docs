title: "CVE-2025-6264 Velociraptor priviledge escalation via UpdateConfig artifact"
description: |
    Velociraptor normally requires high permissions to launch dangerous artifacts.
    The Admin.Client.UpdateClientConfig is an artifact used to update the client's
    configuration. This artifact did not enforce an additional required permission
    allowing users with COLLECT_CLIENT permissions to collect it from endpoints and
    update the configuration (leading to take over).
