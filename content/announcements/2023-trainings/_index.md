# Digging Deeper With Velociraptor
## Mike Cohen, Digital Paleontologist, Rapid7 Inc. | August 5-8

We are really looking forward to spend the week with other
Velociraptor fans geeking out on DFIR and Velociraptor!

This year we will be presenting an extensive, 4 day long, Velociraptor
training course at
