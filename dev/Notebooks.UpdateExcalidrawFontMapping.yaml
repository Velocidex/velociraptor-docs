  Replaces Excalidraw's old standard font IDs with their new standard IDs in
  `.excalidraw` files.

  This is only needed if you want to open (in other words: import) old
  `.excalidraw` files in [excalidraw.com](excalidraw.com) and keep the fonts
  assigned to their "standard" Excalidraw UI font names.

  Excalidraw have changed their default fonts over time, even though their
  file format hasn't changed (it's currently "version 2"). In their file format
  they use assigned numeric IDs instead of font names and their code maps these
  to the actual fonts.

  | Excalidraw UI font name | CSS/SVG font family name (old) | Excalidraw fontFamily ID (old) | CSS/SVG font family name (new) | Excalidraw fontFamily ID (new) | Velociraptor WOFF2 font file name | What we use it for |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Hand-drawn | Virgil | 1 | Excalifont | 5 | playpen-sans-v13-latin-500 | Default font |
  | Normal | Cascadia | 2 | Nunito | 6 | playpen-sans-v13-latin-800 | Heading font |
  | Code | Assistant | 3 | Comic Shanns | 8 | SVBasicManual | Code font |

  The old ID -> new ID mappings are defined in the variable `font_id_map` and a
  regex to see if files qualify for updating is defined in the `regex_check`
  variable. Update these if necessary.

  Normally you should not need to "update" `.excalidraw` files in this way.
  But if they add new fonts in future with new fontFamily IDs, and assign them
  to their "standard" UI font names, then this may be needed to be allow opening
  and re-exporting old excalidraw files.

  ### Notes

  - This notebook works with local files and is intended to be run in "gui mode"
    on Linux.
  - **Will potentially do bad things if run on Windows!** So don't do that.
