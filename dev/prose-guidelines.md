# Guidelines for prose (written content)

This document provides guidance for writing style in the Velociraptor
documentation. It specifies some informal standards and advice with the goal of
ensuring as much consistency as possible in our prose content.

The guidance in this document is intended to:
- allow newcomers to quickly familiarize themselves with the writing style rules
  that have been used in the existing content on the documentation website.
- centralize style-related decisions for written content.

This document is WIP.

### HTML content

Only use inline HTML when markdown cannot provide the same result, and even so
try to avoid inline HTML except where absolutely unavoidable. Having as much
content as possible in markdown form simplifies website style changes, as well
as automated style checking and content updates.

When writing content in HTML the same style rules apply as described in the
Markdown Content section.

## Markdown content

Our docs website is compiled by Hugo which interprets markdown based on the
Commonmark standard. Therefore it's best to avoid using features from any other
flavours of markdown such as GFM, as they may not be rendered correctly or at
all by Hugo.

### Inline code

We try not to overuse `inline code` or else the prose starts to look like
patchwork.

Use `inline code` only for:

- file paths, file names
- CLI commands, keywords, flags.
- VQL keywords, variable names and snippets
- Artifact names, artifact parameter/key names and values, field names and
  values.

Do not use it for:

- error messages
- brand names
- terms that the user will type (use quotes instead)

- defining new terms
- names of GUI controls, controls and menu options

For the last 2 cases above it is recommended to use bold text for emphasis the
first time a term is used. When doing so it is not necessary to use quotes
around the term.

### Block code

Preferably format VQL code blocks with the VQL formatter, for consistency.


### Admonitions (notices)

Try not to overuse them. Especially try not to have two or more of them
together. Try to only use them when the reader's attention need to be drawn to
something specific.

Often the content in an admonition can be rewritten as part of the normal text
body.

### Unordered lists

Use `-` not `*`. Just for consistency.

### Shell commands

privilege indicator - this will depend on future changes to styling. TBD

use generic file names. omit version numbers and arch.

use platform alternatives where applicable

When providing command examples we should use a consistent order for the
command components: `[binary]` `[command]` `[subcommand]` `[flags]` `[args]`

### Page links

Use the Hugo shortcode `[]({{< ref "/abc/xyz/" >}})` for page links so that Hugo
will do link checking.

## Page content structure

## Page metadata

Always try to add a `summary`. When using the `children` shortcode it defaults
to creating a summary if one is not defined, which means it grabs the first few
paragraphs from the page. Usually this "auto-summary" is unsightly so it's
better to carefully craft one rather than relying on "auto".


### KB articles

Tags are recommended. These help users find related content. Do not use
meaningless tags such as "velociraptor" or "dfir".

### VQL reference documents

Top level section headings should be level-3.

- Description (heading is autogenerated)
  - Lead
  - Body
- Example (or Examples)
  - one or more examples.
- Notes
  - notes or cautions about common considerations or pitfalls
- See also
  - links to other functions that are likely to be related or of interest.
