  Trawler [https://github.com/joeavanzato/Trawler] is a PowerShell script designed to help Incident
  Responders rapidly identify potential adversary persistence mechanisms on Windows.  It is similar
  in nature to PersistenceSniper with additional targeted checks as well as the capability to operate
  against a 'dead box' (mounted drive). The output is simplified compared to PersistenceSniper, providing
  the user with the details needed to kick off an investigation into any identified mechanisms.
  Think of these tools as autoruns on steroids.

  Please ensure the Velociraptor binary (and child powershell process) are excluded in any EDR/AV products.
