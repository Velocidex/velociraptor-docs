description: |
  This artefact will collect Scheduled task information from the registry without 
  relying on the existance of an XML file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks.
  
  The artifact will attempt to find relevant XML data if exists.
  There is also an option to show only tasks  missing a Security Descriptor.
  
  TODO: cleanup, write test and add to main repo
