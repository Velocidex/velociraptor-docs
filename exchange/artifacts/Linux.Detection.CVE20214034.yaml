name: Linux.Detection.CVE20214034
description: |
   This artifact lists processes running as root that were spawns by processes that are not
   running as root. This kind of behavior is normal for things like sudo or su but for other
   processes (especially /bin/bash) it could represent a process launched via CVE-2021-4034.

   The artifact looks for running processes with this property as well as search the auth
   log files for evidence of past execution of this exploit.
