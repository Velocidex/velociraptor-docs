    `man` is typically used to provide information about how to use various commands. It's configuration file is located at `/private/etc/man.conf` on most macOS systems.
    
    While root access is required to do so, this configuration could be modified by an adversary to stealthily achieve persistence in an environment. 
    
    This artifact collects any entries in `man.conf` which appear to specify a non-default binary for use with `man` or `whatis`.
