name: MacOS.ParallelsVM.SuspendedMemory
description: |
   Looks for suspended Parallels VM owned by any user on a MacOS system. Can automatically upload the virtual memory files if found.
   
   If a "*.mem.sh" file exists, that VM is running and not suspended.
   
   **NOTE:** Uploading the Parallels memory file can take a while due to the size.
