        This artifact allows for live hunting through Apple's Unified Logs using the native `log` command.

        The Unified Logs can be a great resource for learning about system events. There are many logging subsystems that can provide a wealth of data for investigators.

        However, users should ensure their searches are scoped appropriately (date/time/event type/etc), as a lot of data can be returned, which could affect the ability to review the collected data or potentially impact client performance.

        The `Predicate` parameter can be used to filter logs. Example filters are included as artifact parameters.

        Users may need to adjust the `Length` parameter to accomodate a large number of events being returned.

        If you would like to perform an offline collection, or only care about collecting the raw files associated with this data, consider using [Exchange.MacOS.UnifiedLogParser](https://docs.velociraptor.app/exchange/artifacts/pages/macos.unifiedlogparser/).
