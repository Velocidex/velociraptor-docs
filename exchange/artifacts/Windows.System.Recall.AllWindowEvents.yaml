   This artefact will read and correlate several tables to do with Microsoft Recall.
   
   The main database is held here:
      C:\Users\\*\AppData\Local\CoreAIPlatform.00\UKP\{DA73A0DB-DDF4-4A81-9506-CCB5DE8B0F14}\ukg.db
        
   This artefact will join multiple tables together to enrich the Window Capture events of recall.

  - name: ukgPath
    default: /AppData/Local/CoreAIPlatform.00/UKP/*/ukg.db
