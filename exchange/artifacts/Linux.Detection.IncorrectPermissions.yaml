    NOTE: Requires velociraptor 0.7.1 or higher. – Alternatively, import the
    artifact dependency Linux.Sys.Groups manually into your installation.

    This artifacts checks a number of files and directories to verify whether
    they have the expected owner, group owner and mode. A file with an incorrect
    owner may allow attackers to modify important system files. Similarly,
    incorrect mode, like word-writable configuration or passwd/shadow files may
    also be signs of serious misconfiguration or signs of malicious activity.

    The parameter FilesToInspect contains lines of globs to search for. Each
    line may specify expected user, expected group, expected file mode and
    expected directory mode. It is very important that the order of the lines
    is in order of increasing specificity. For example:

    ```csv
    /etc/*,root,root,644,755
    /etc/?shadow*,,shadow,640,
    ```

    Here, every file in the directory /etc is expected to be owned by root:root
    and have file permissions set to 644, and group permissions set to 755.
    The files under /etc matching "?shadow*" are still expected to be owned by
    root, since the override for user is empty, but the group is no longer
    expected to be "root", but "shadow". File permissions should be "640"
    instead of "644". Note that this is an example and will most likely return
    hits, since a number of files in /etc have different owners and modes.

    "User" may either be an integer (UID) or a string (username). "Group"
    may be either an integer (GID) or a string (group name). The names for all
    UIDs and GIDs are looked up and displayed along with their IDs in the result.

    Modes may be specified in either octal numbers or strings.

    Modes specified in octal numbers, e.g. 755, 640, 1777, are matched
    using a regular expression, so that both "0640", "640" and "100640" matches
    "100640". An implicit anchor, '$', is used to match against the end of the
    octal mode string.

    When using mode strings (NumericMode unchecked), modes take the format
    "-rwx-r-x-r-x". Regex comparison is used, and an implicit '$' anchor
    is inserted at the end of the string. String modes allows for verifying only
    certain bits of permissions, like ensuring that only the owner has write 
    access, no one has permission to execute, but read access is not important:
    "r.-.--.--". Or ensuring that SUID/GUID is not set. For finding files
    specifically with SUID set, look at Linux.Sys.SUID.

    Mixing both formats is not supported and will result in unexpected results.

    This artifact can also be used to look for all files owned by root with
    world-writable permissions, for instance. Uncheck NumericMode, add a glob,
    select "root" as owner and enter any invalid permission string in UserMode.
    This will return every file owned by root. In the notebook, add something
    like "WHERE Mode=~'w.$'" to the query. The User field may also be empty,
    essentially returning every file in the glob as long as the UserMode field
    contains an invalid value. This turns this artifact into a file finder-like
    tool with metadata like username and group names for further processing.

    The following columns are returned:

      - OSPath
      - IsDir
      - UID
      - User
      - EUser (expected user from FilesToInspect)
      - GID
      - Group
      - EGroup (expected group from FilesToInspect)
      - Mode (file/directory mode/permissions)
      - EMode (expected file/directory mode from FilesToInspect)
      - Mismatch (a comma-separated string of one or several of "uid", "gid" and "mode")
      - Mtime
      - Ctime
      - Atime

    Note that the artifacts used to look up usernames and group names use the
    files /etc/passwd and /etc/group. You will have to modify this artifact to
    use `getent passwd`/`getent group` to use NSS and get users and groups from
    Active Directory etc.

    The provided default values in FilesToInspect is an example only.
