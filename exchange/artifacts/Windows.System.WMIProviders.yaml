description: |
   List the WMI providers in the system.
   
   It is possible to laterally move by installing a fake provider in the system, and then calling
   it remotely. This artifact enumerates all WMI providers and recovers the binary that runs when 
   loaded.
   
   Test using https://github.com/Cybereason/Invoke-WMILM (Will run as SYSTEM)
   ```
   Invoke-WMILM -Target localhost -Type Provider -Name notepad -Username test -Password test -Command notepad.exe
   ```
