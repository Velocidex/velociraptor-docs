   This artifact by itself only indicates that the PowerPick tool may have
   been invoked on the client. To capture additional context, ensure that
   Powershell script block and module logging are enabled on the clients and
   deploy the Windows.ETW.Powershell artifact from the Exchange.
   
   -----
   
   This artifact is based on on PowerPick research by Crowdstrike in 
   https://www.crowdstrike[.]com/blog/getting-the-bacon-from-cobalt-strike-beacon/
   
   As noted in the blog post, when PowerPick tool is run, the PowerShell logs
   on the target system may contain an EID 400 event where the
   HostVersion and EngineVersion fields in the message have different values.
   
   In recent puprle team exercises, we observed that the mismatched HostVersion
   value was always "1.0", providing a simple way to monitor for this activity 
   as a backup to other PowerShell or CobaltStrike rules.
   
   If this artifact generates an event on a client, check the PowerShell Operational
   logs for suspicious 410x events (especially 4104).  If the Windows.ETW.Powershell
   artifact is also enabled on the client and did not fire an event, update that
   artifact's IOC list with the new information and redeploy it.
