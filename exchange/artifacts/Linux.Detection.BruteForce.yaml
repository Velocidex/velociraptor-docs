   Linux detection brute force module.
   This code is based on https://github.com/RCarras/linforce/blob/main/linforce.sh
      
   This module uses btmp/wtmp files to search for possible brute force attacks comparing:
   
   * Wtmp (successful attempts) and btmp (failed attempts) Logs.
   * Time interval between failed login attempts, and against successful logins.
   
   Type of attacks:
   
   * Basic Brute Force Attack: multiple consecutive attempts from an IP.
   * Password Spraying: multiple consecutive attempts from different users with the same password.  
   * Dynamic IP Attack: multiple consecutive attempts from different IPs.
